title: Testing Obsidian Publish as a blog solution
publish: true
hugo_publish: true

I spontaneously had the desire to start up my blogging again.

I tested Obsidian Publish as a solution. It seemed very promising, but unfortunately it didn't work out for me.

First of all, you need to manually publish your changes after adding a "publish: true" property to a file, which is a big hiccup in the process.

I then tinkered with n8n to automatically syndicate from the RSS feed that it creates.

However, I found that the RSS feed was full of bugs and was not being updated after I added files.
