# Knowing Containers, Databases & Code is Magic

Forget making money.

If you learn to write Python code, work with containers, and how to store data in databases, there are so many interesting things you can build to enhance your life.

These three elements are all that are needed to create comprehensive applications that you can use to track, store and manipulate massive amounts of data.

Whether it is your own knowledge, health metrics, or data from sensors, the possibilities are endless.

It truly feels like magic every time I build something new to solve a little problem for myself.
