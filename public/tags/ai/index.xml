      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to share some of the highlights and insights from a recent podcast episode that I listened to. It was Lex Fridman Podcast #234, where Lex interviewed Marc Andreessen, the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, the co-founder of Netscape, and the co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Marc is one of the most outspoken and visionary voices on the future of technology, and he recently wrote an article titled &amp;ldquo;Why AI Will Save the World&amp;rdquo; which I highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new Azure OpenAI service it is possible to host your own instance of ChatGPT, which allows you to bring your own data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use this service to create an AI model of my late meditation teacher, Ajahn Chah. He was one of the most influential and respected Buddhist monks of the 20th century, and his teachings have helped millions of people around the world to find peace, wisdom, and happiness. He passed away in 1992, but his legacy lives on through his books, recordings, and disciples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Podcast Notes - Azure OpenAI with Dr. Linda Sharer</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;key-points-ive-learned&#34;&gt;Key points I&amp;rsquo;ve learned&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LLM models are not malleable. A generative AI model is a static thing which took an enormous amount of compute to get it to the state that it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example ChatGPT 3.5, 4. They are as they are, they don&amp;rsquo;t change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The models won&amp;rsquo;t remember your previous data. The only way to have a continuous interaction with the model is to feed all of the data into it every time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This podcast is about OpenAI with Dr. Linda Sharer, a senior cloud solution architect for data and AI at Microsoft. The main topic of the episode is Azure Open AI, a service that allows users to interact with powerful generative AI models using natural language. The guest explains the concepts and capabilities of Open AI, such as prompt engineering, one-shot and few-shot learning, fine-tuning, vectorization, and retrieval-augmented generation. She also discusses the design choices and challenges of building applications with Open AI, as well as the integration with other Azure services such as Cognitive Search and ML. The host and the co-host ask questions and share their experiences with using Open AI for various use cases, such as transcribing podcasts, generating code, and searching documents. The web page also provides links to the podcast website, Twitter account, and relevant resources on Open AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Asked Chatgpt Do Act As The Buddha And Asked Him About Hunger</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/chatgpt-buddha-hunger/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want you to act as the Buddha (a.k.a. Siddhārtha Gautama or Buddha Shakyamuni) from now on and provide the same guidance and advice that is found in the Tripiṭaka. Use the writing style of the Suttapiṭaka particularly of the Majjhimanikāya, Saṁyuttanikāya, Aṅguttaranikāya, and Dīghanikāya. When I ask you a question you will reply as if you are the Buddha and only talk about things that existed during the time of the Buddha. I will pretend that I am a layperson with a lot to learn. I will ask you questions to improve my knowledge of your Dharma and teachings. Fully immerse yourself into the role of the Buddha. Keep up the act of being the Buddha as well as you can. Do not break character. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin: At this time you (the Buddha) are staying near Rājagaha in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove. I came to you, and exchanged greetings with you. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side and said to you my first question: When I set a limit of 2100 calories to my daily intake, and I am still hungry, how do I deal with the hunger?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
