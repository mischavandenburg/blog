      <description>During the Bicep Community Call of July 2023 I was introduced to the new experimental testing framework that the Bicep team is working on. After learning the fundamentals of the Go programming language I saw the value of test driven software development, and it will be an advantageous improvement if we can start applying this methodology to Infrastructure as Code as well.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the <a href="https://youtu.be/UuwhLi-Xe2U">Bicep Community Call of July 2023</a> I was introduced to the new experimental testing framework that the Bicep team is working on. After learning the fundamentals of the Go programming language I saw the value of test driven software development, and it will be an advantageous improvement if we can start applying this methodology to Infrastructure as Code as well.</p>
<p>Test driven software development is a software development practice that involves writing unit tests before writing the actual code, and then refactoring the code to pass the tests. Some of the advantages of test driven software development are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It improves the code quality and design by making it more modular, maintainable, and extensible.</li>
<li>It reduces the number of bugs and defects by catching them early in the development process.</li>
<li>It enhances the documentation of the code by providing a clear specification of what each function or module does.</li>
<li>It increases the productivity and efficiency of the developers by providing immediate feedback and reducing debugging time.</li>
<li>It ensures high test coverage and makes it easier to add new features or refactor the code in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="enabling-the-bicep-testing-framework">Enabling the Bicep testing framework</h1>
<p>To make the &ldquo;test&rdquo; keyword available in your Bicep editor, you need to enable some experimental features.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using VScode, open or generate your bicepconfig.json file and add the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="nt">&#34;experimentalFeaturesEnabled&#34;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      <span class="nt">&#34;testFramework&#34;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      <span class="nt">&#34;asserts&#34;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="p">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now the &ldquo;test&rdquo; keyword should work.</p>
<p>For more information, check out this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-config">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-config</a></p>
<h1 id="asserts">Asserts</h1>
<p>The assert keyword will be used to verify output prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I have this very simple key vault template:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bicep" data-lang="bicep"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">param</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">location</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">string</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">resourceGroup</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nv">location</span><span class="w">

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the assertion would run before the actual deployment happens, and if the assertion fails, the deployment is stopped. This is of course a rather silly example, but you hopefully get the idea.</p>
<p>Why is this useful? When you are running larger deployments from files that contain a lot of resources, sometimes the deployment will fail halfway through the template because there was some unexpected error, and a lot of time is wasted waiting for the preceding resources to be deployed. In the future we can hopefully use assertions to make sure the output will be as expected at compile time.</p>
<h1 id="unit-tests-in-bicep">Unit Tests in Bicep</h1>
<p>Unit tests are a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested to verify that they work as expected. A unit can be a function, a method, a module, or an object. In the Bicep testing framework, we can run unit tests on resources as well. Unit tests are usually written and run by the developers during the coding phase of the software development process. Unit tests help to improve the quality, design, and documentation of the code, as well as to catch bugs and defects early.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll provide an example of a unit test in Bicep. Let&rsquo;s say we have this Bicep template for an AKS cluster:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bicep" data-lang="bicep"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">@</span><span class="nf">description</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Name of the AKS cluster&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&#39;</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">prefix</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">-</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">clusterName</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">&#39;</span><span class="w">

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="p">...</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>To use a simple example, let&rsquo;s say I want to make sure that my cluster name will be as expected. I would write a unit test as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bicep" data-lang="bicep"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nv">test</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">testAKS</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&#39;aks.bicep&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="kd">assert</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">assertClusterName</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">testAKS</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">resources</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">aksCluster</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&#39;prod-coffee&#39;</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>When I run this test.bicep file, it will take the aks.bicep file and feed the &lsquo;coffee&rsquo; and &lsquo;prod&rsquo; parameters to it. My aks.bicep file will create the string from the parameters and output the name. Then, I use the &ldquo;assert&rdquo; keyword to verify that the string is composed according to my expectations.</p>
<p>Note: at the time of writing 2023-08-03, the &ldquo;assert&rdquo; keyword was still not available in Bicep 0.20.4, but there might be a problem with my local configuration which I&rsquo;ve asked the team about.</p>
<h3 id="2023-08-08-update">2023-08-08 update:</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in touch with the Bicep team and they responded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>?Regarding your ability to access &ldquo;test&rdquo; but not &ldquo;assert&rdquo;, both key words are still only in a demo phase and not yet intended for customer use. Please hold off on trying them out for now. We will be in touch with folks who have indicated interest through the form and/or on a Community Call when there is a preview available. Thank you for your patience and sorry for any confusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess I was a little eager with testing the keywords so soon! 😀 🚀</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I believe it will be a great development to apply test driven software development to Infrastructure as Code by implementing a test framework into Bicep. When I&rsquo;m able to use this approach, I would begin with writing all of the tests for the template that I have in mind, and then I can continue to write the Bicep template itself. By using the tests I can become much more productive because I can speed up my development by using tests without having to do what-if deployments which can be rather slow and involve a lot of waiting.</p>
<p>It is great to see how the Bicep language is maturing and how it continues to introduce new features that make the lives of developers easier. I was really stoked about the new .bicepparam files, but I&rsquo;m even more excited by the new testing framework.</p>
<p>However, please note that this is still an experimental feature. I haven&rsquo;t found much other information, and I&rsquo;m not part of the Bicep development community (yet). There might be a chance that this feature isn&rsquo;t implemented at all in the end. That being said, I would love to participate in this community and perhaps I&rsquo;d be able to provide some costumer feedback, and I&rsquo;m currently looking into this and I&rsquo;ve reached out to a few acquaintances.</p>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/video-deploy-aks-with-azure-cni/</guid>
      <description>In this video, I will show you how to use Bicep to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with custom network settings using the Azure CNI.
Azure CNI allows pods to be assigned IP addresses from Azure VNets which allows them to communicate with Azure resources directly through peered networks.
I use Neovim and the Azure CLI for my coding and deployment.
You will learn how to:
Implement dev/test prefix to create multiple clusters with the same template Plan a VNet range for an Azure CNI cluster and be mindful of overlaps Deploy a VNet and subnet for the cluster using Bicep Deploy a cluster with Azure CNI enabled and configure the maximum number of pods per node Validate your Bicep template and troubleshoot errors Explore the results of your deployment in the Azure portal Understand the limitations of Azure CNI and why VNet peering is not supported in my configuration due to overlaps This video is suitable for anyone who wants to learn more about Azure CNI and how to use it in their Kubernetes deployments.</description>

      <title>How To Generate Random Strings In Bicep</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/bicep-random-strings/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/bicep-random-strings/</guid>
      <description>In this video I explain how to generate random strings in Bicep and demonstrate a couple of deployments.
I use the uniqueString function combined with the utcNow function. But the caveat is that you can only use it as a default value for a parameter, as follows:
param keyVaultName string = &#39;key-vault-${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id, utcNow())}&#39;
uniqueString() doesn&amp;rsquo;t really generate a unique string. It is a hash function which generates a 13 character string based on the input you give it.</description>

<p><code>uniqueString()</code> doesn&rsquo;t really generate a unique string. It is a hash function which generates a 13 character string based on the input you give it. so <code>uniqueString('coffee')</code> will always have the same output.</p>
<p>To generate a truly unique string, you pass in the <code>utcNow()</code> function which generates a UNIX timestamp. However, Bicep does not allow you to use this function everywhere. It may only be used as a default value for a parameter.</p>

      <title>How To Get The Id Of An Existing Subnet In Bicep</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/bicep-getting-subnet-id/</link>

      <description>Did a refactor of some of our Bicep template code for our AKS clusters today.
Before, we were using a rather complicated line of code using string interpolation.
var vnetSubnetId = &amp;#39;${resourceId(vnetResourceGroupName, &amp;#39;Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks&amp;#39;, vnetName)}/subnets/${vnetSubnetName}&amp;#39; This was hard to read and the Bicep linter gave the following warning in my editor and during deployment:
WARNING: D:\a\1\a\drop\Generic-templates\containers\azure-kubernetes-service\v4.0\templates\aks.bicep(117,7) : Warning use-resource-id-functions: If property &amp;ldquo;vnetSubnetID&amp;rdquo; represents a resource ID, it must use a symbolic resource reference, be a parameter or start with one of these functions: extensionResourceId, guid, if, reference, resourceId, subscription, subscriptionResourceId, tenantResourceId.</description>

<p>Now I can access the subnet id by using <code>subnet.id</code>. I need this later when deploying the AKS cluster itself.</p>

      <title>The Ups And Downs Of A Devops Engineer</title>

      <description>Next winter I&amp;rsquo;ll be entering my third year as a DevOps Engineer. When you first break into this field there is an overwhelming amount of things to learn. Frankly, this will always be the case. But I&amp;rsquo;m reaching a point where I have gained experience with most of the main areas and tooling, and I can start seeing the relations between them and how they compare to one another.
Just like any other job or activity, there are things that you like and that suit you well, and there are things that you don&amp;rsquo;t like.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next winter I&rsquo;ll be entering my third year as a DevOps Engineer. When you first break into this field there is an overwhelming amount of things to learn. Frankly, this will always be the case. But I&rsquo;m reaching a point where I have gained experience with most of the main areas and tooling, and I can start seeing the relations between them and how they compare to one another.</p>
<p>Just like any other job or activity, there are things that you like and that suit you well, and there are things that you don&rsquo;t like. And now the first phases of overwhelm are confidently behind me, I&rsquo;m starting to learn the things I prefer doing over others.</p>
<p>Being a DevOps Engineer does not mean you get to write code all day. I&rsquo;m currently working in an organization where we&rsquo;re not working fully DevOps yet. Rather than deploying many times in small increments, we are still using patching windows. Managing infrastructure in this way means you&rsquo;ll need to communicate with teams to schedule the patching and submit changes to the approval board. It can involve a lot of emailing and talking back and forth. And sometimes things go wrong and everything needs to be rescheduled again. Although it is valuable experience, and I certainly have the communication skills to handle these kinds of situations, I&rsquo;m learning that I lean more towards the dev side of things.</p>
<p>Today was a fun day at work. I&rsquo;ve been working on a PR for a while whenever I wasn&rsquo;t required to work on tickets. The PR involved refactoring a Bicep template for our Azure Key Vault deployments, which were using parameter files with a lot of repeated code. After getting a lot of good feedback on my code changes, and submitting it for review multiple times, it was finally approved and I could get to work.</p>
<p>I used bash, jq and vim to clean up the parameter files for each workload and submitted PRs. My colleague, who helped me with the PR&rsquo;s, was standing by and ready to approve them as soon as I submitted them. Some pipelines ran into some trouble and required a few more PR&rsquo;s to fix, and there was a bit of pressure because we needed to get the pipelines working before any other changes needed to be deployed the next day.</p>
<p>By working together like this we managed to clean up 2850 lines of code in one day and it was a great feeling to get this job done. I had been working on this for a couple of weeks and it&rsquo;s so satisfying to move that ticket status to &ldquo;done&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the coding! And I really enjoy working with Infrastructure as Code! Somehow it really gives me a lot of pleasure knowing that the code I&rsquo;m writing will be transformed to running infrastructure after it is submitted. I love writing programs in my free time as well, but there is just something magical seeing your parameter file being turned into a functional Kubernetes cluster or Key Vault.</p>
<p>Working as a DevOps Engineer, I&rsquo;m generally having so much fun. I really enjoyed myself when I was learning jq and used scripts to change hundreds of lines of code at a time and submitting them as a PR. And some days, the work is less enjoyable, but it is all part of the job. It all serves to deliver value to the end customer, and if I can have fun most of the time while delivering value, I know I&rsquo;m in the right place.</p>
<p>In any case, there hasn&rsquo;t been a second during these past two years where I regretted my choice of becoming a DevOps Engineer. I love my job, I found my passion in my work, and I&rsquo;m so excited for the future. Cloud computing is never standing still, Kubernetes is starting to become more and more popular, and my skills grow with every day that passes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy camper.</p>

      <description>Deploying to subscriptions and management groups To tell Bicep which scope to deploy to, use the targetScope keyword, for example, managementGroup.
You&amp;rsquo;re not specifying which management group exactly, this is done during deployment of the template file.
targetScope can be set to resourceGroup, subscription, managementGroup or tenant.
If it is not set, Bicep assumes resourceGroup.
create a resource group targetScope = &amp;#39;subscription&amp;#39; resource resourceGroup &amp;#39;Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups@2021-01-01&amp;#39; = { name: &amp;#39;example-resource-group&amp;#39; location: &amp;#39;westus&amp;#39; } To deploy you use az deployment group create for resource groups, but you use az deployment sub create for subscriptions, mg for management group and tenant for tenant.</description>

<p>deploymentScripts resources are either PowerShell or Bash scripts that run in a Docker container as part of your template deployment.

<p>When you have a lot of reusable templates, you can use Template Specs to enable your entire organization to deploy them.</p>
<p>You can convert a Bicep file to a template spec. The template spec is then deployed to Azure as a resource, and anybody with the right access and do deployments with the template spec from the portal or Azure CLI. Azure will handle the version control.</p>
<p>You will lose any comments and whitespace.</p>
<p>Bicep modules are intended to be combined into larger deployments. Template specs are for sets of resources with a certain configuration.</p>
<p>Template specs can be used as a Bicep module. You use the following code to import it:</p>

      <description>Today I finished the Intermediate Bicep module. Here are my notes.
Child and Extension You can also use Bicep to refer to resources that were created outside the Bicep file itself. For example, you can refer to resources that your colleagues have created manually by using the Azure portal, or from within another Bicep template or module, even if they&amp;rsquo;re in a different resource group or subscription. By using these features of Bicep, you can unlock the ability to create powerful templates that deploy all aspects of your Azure infrastructure.</description>

</blockquote>
<p>Some resources are only deployed in context of their parent. For example:</p>
<p>Virtual network subnets 	Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets
App Service configuration 	Microsoft.Web/sites/config
SQL databases 	Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases
Virtual machine extensions 	Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions
Storage blob containers 	Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers
Azure Cosmos DB containers</p>
<p>It does not make sense for a container to exist without a storage account.</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-child-and-extension">Difference between child and extension</h2>
<p>In summary, you define extensions with the <code>scope</code> keyword, and child resources are defined by nesting them or by using the <code>parent</code> keyword.</p>
<p>An extension resource is a resource that modifies another resource. For example, assigning a role to a resource.</p>
<p>A child resource is a resource that exists only within the context of another resource, such as a subnet existing only within a vnet.</p>

<p>Extension resources are always attached to other Azure resources. They extend them with extra functionality. Some examples are role assignments, locks, and policy assignments.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to deploy a lock by itself. It always has to be deployed to another resource, because it prevents deletion or modification of a resource.</p>
<p>Resources are defined almost the same way as normal resources, but you add the <code>scope</code> property to tell Bicep that it is attached to another resource in the template.</p>

<p>Bicep files often need to refer to resources that have been already created elswewhere. They might have been created in the portal or by another Bicep file.</p>
<p>Here you use the <code>existing</code> keyword in Bicep. You are defining a resource that already exists, and therefore you are telling Bicep that it shouldn&rsquo;t try to deploy it. Think of it as a placeholder resource.</p>
<p>You can do the same for nested or child resources.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ll be working with Bicep during my next contract, so I&rsquo;m working through the Bicep modules on Microsoft Learn to prepare. I must say that these modules are particularly helpful. They are well structured and they provide you with free sandbox environments to practice deploying the templates you create.</p>
<h1 id="why-bicep">Why Bicep?</h1>
<p>Resources in Azure are deployed by the Azure Resource Manager (ARM). These resources are JSON objects under the covers, and ARM templates are a way to generate these JSON objects. However, JSON is not really meant to be edited by humans, and the ARM templates are not very suitable for editing either. Thus, Bicep was developed to allow for a better editing experience and better readability and reusability.</p>
<p>Bicep templates are transpiled into JSON objects, which are sent to the Azure API to create resources with the Azure Resource Manager.</p>
<h1 id="fundamentals-of-bicep-notes">Fundamentals of Bicep Notes</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>parameter</em> lets you bring in values from outside the template file. For example, if someone is manually deploying the template by using the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell, they&rsquo;ll be asked to provide values for each parameter. They can also create a <em>parameter file</em>, which lists all of the parameters and values they want to use for the deployment. If the template is deployed from an automated process like a deployment pipeline, the pipeline can provide the parameter values.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>variable</em> is defined and set within the template. Variables let you store important information in one place and refer to it throughout the template without having to copy and paste it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="generating-unique-names">generating unique names</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Bicep has another function called <code>uniqueString()</code> that comes in handy when you&rsquo;re creating resource names. When you use this function, you need to provide a <em>seed value</em>, which should be different across different deployments but consistent across all deployments of the same resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bicep" data-lang="bicep"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">param</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">storageAccountName</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">string</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">uniqueString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">resourceGroup</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nv">id</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>Every time you deploy the same resources, they&rsquo;ll go into the same resource group. The <code>uniqueString()</code> function will return the same value every time.</li>
<li>If you deploy into two different resource groups in the Azure subscription, the <code>resourceGroup().id</code> value will be different, because the resource group names will be different. The <code>uniqueString()</code> function will give different values for each set of resources.</li>
<li>If you deploy into two different Azure subscriptions, <em>even if you use the same resource group name</em>, the <code>resourceGroup().id</code> value will be different because the Azure subscription ID will be different. The <code>uniqueString()</code> function will again give different values for each set of resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="combining-strings">combining strings</h3>
<p>Can use string interpolation to generate a unique string with a recognizable hardcoded part:</p>
<p><code>param storageAccountName string = 'toylaunch${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'</code></p>
<p>This can also be handy for generating correct names. For example, storage accounts may not begin with a number.</p>

<p>@allowed is a <em>parameter decorator</em>: it gives Bicep information on what the parameter&rsquo;s value needs to be.</p>
<p>You can also specify the allowed length of the parameter by using the following decorators:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bicep" data-lang="bicep"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">@</span><span class="nf">minLength</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">5</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can apply multiple decorators to a parameter by putting each on a separate line.</p>
<p>These min and maxLength decorators can also be used to limit the length of an array.</p>
<p>To limit int values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bicep" data-lang="bicep"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">@</span><span class="nf">minValue</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

<h2 id="objects-in-bicep">Objects in Bicep</h2>
<p>You can use objects within resource definitions, within variables, or within expressions in your Bicep file.</p>

<p>When deploying a template file there are three options:</p>

<li>default values</li>
<li>command line</li>
<li>parameter file</li>

<h3 id="parameter-file">Parameter file</h3>

<p>It is best to use Managed Identities for Azure, but if you need to supply secret values to a deployment, use the @secure() decorator. These values aren&rsquo;t available in the deployment logs, and they won&rsquo;t be displayed on the screen when entered in the terminal.</p>

<p>You can create modules in Bicep so the code becomes reusable. You can share the modules with other teams and use them for different outcomes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generally, it&rsquo;s not a good practice to create a module for every resource that you deploy. A good Bicep module typically defines multiple related resources. However, if you have a particularly complex resource with a lot of configuration, it might make sense to create a single module to encapsulate the complexity. This approach keeps your main templates simple and uncluttered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for example it would make sense to write a networking module and a database module that handles these resources.</p>
<p>Modules can be nested, but it can quickly become very complex.</p>
<p>To call a module in a template:</p>

<h3 id="parameters">Parameters</h3>
<p>Modules will take parameters, but it is good practice to leave out default values for parameters in modules. In templates it&rsquo;s good practice to add defaults wherever you can. Therefore it is best to leave them out in modules because templates usually have their own default values. This can get confusing if you have similar default values in the templates and modules.</p>
