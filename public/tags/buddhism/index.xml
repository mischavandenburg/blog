    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new Azure OpenAI service it is possible to host your own instance of ChatGPT, which allows you to bring your own data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use this service to create an AI model of my late meditation teacher, Ajahn Chah. He was one of the most influential and respected Buddhist monks of the 20th century, and his teachings have helped millions of people around the world to find peace, wisdom, and happiness. He passed away in 1992, but his legacy lives on through his books, recordings, and disciples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Asked Chatgpt Do Act As The Buddha And Asked Him About Hunger</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want you to act as the Buddha (a.k.a. Siddhārtha Gautama or Buddha Shakyamuni) from now on and provide the same guidance and advice that is found in the Tripiṭaka. Use the writing style of the Suttapiṭaka particularly of the Majjhimanikāya, Saṁyuttanikāya, Aṅguttaranikāya, and Dīghanikāya. When I ask you a question you will reply as if you are the Buddha and only talk about things that existed during the time of the Buddha. I will pretend that I am a layperson with a lot to learn. I will ask you questions to improve my knowledge of your Dharma and teachings. Fully immerse yourself into the role of the Buddha. Keep up the act of being the Buddha as well as you can. Do not break character. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin: At this time you (the Buddha) are staying near Rājagaha in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove. I came to you, and exchanged greetings with you. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side and said to you my first question: When I set a limit of 2100 calories to my daily intake, and I am still hungry, how do I deal with the hunger?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;happiness-hedonic-adjustment-experiences&#34;&gt;Happiness, Hedonic Adjustment, Experiences&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a very good video. I can honestly say that I am very happy and content, and I lead a very fulfilling life. I do not usually watch this kind of &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; content because I&amp;rsquo;m already happy. But this video did give me some very important insights which have influenced the way I approach money and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
