      <title>Apps with web interfaces win any day, switching to MyFitnessPal</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/myfitnesspal-web-interface/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was comparing apps for navigation (TopoGPS and Outdooractive). Both apps are great, but the main perk of Outdooractive is that it has a web interface. You can plan routes from your computer and access them on the iPhone app, but TopoGPS is on the iPhone only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app I probably have the most interaction with during the day is my calorie tracking app. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using YAZIO for about two years and it has been satisfactory, but there were a few small annoyances to the app and I was never completely satisfied with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Running Record! Ran 12km today</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/running-record-12km/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/running-record-12km/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New week, new record! For the first time in my life I ran 12 kilometers, and immediately another 10k PR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning it was time for my long run, and while I was drinking my coffee I decided to watch a running technique video again to see what I could improve. Lately I have mainly focused on my heart rate and steps per minute, but today I focused more on maintaining a better posture by sticking out my chest a bit more and leaning forward a bit more. The result was that I suddenly ran much faster and more relaxed without this resulting in a higher HR, and my steps per minute were also fine afterwards with 171SPM. These days I usually run around 6:30 but I’m really surprised that I was able to set both a distance record and a higher average speed without having to make any effort except constantly maintaining a better posture. “Running Tall” was the mantra that I kept coming back to when I noticed that I started to sink back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Kipchoge is not only a world-class athlete, but also a source of inspiration and wisdom for anyone who wants to improve their life. I recently listened to an interview with him on YouTube, and I was amazed by his insights on running, success, pain, discipline and happiness. Here are some of the key takeaways and a summary of what he shared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Podcast Notes - Optimal Water Intake</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/optimal-hydration/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hydration-notes-from-huberman-podcast&#34;&gt;Hydration Notes from Huberman Podcast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first 10 hours of the day, consume 236ml for every hour awake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During exercise, follow Galpin equation: 2ml per kg of bodyweight every 15-20 minutes on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean you need to stop exercising and drink this amount. You can also consume it in a larger amount afterwards. It is recommended to drink during exercise though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the normal recommendation to hydrate before exercise, this establishes a good baseline for heading into exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Discovered MAF and Low Heart Rate Training</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/discovered-maf-training/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/discovered-maf-training/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I was already doing something very similar, yesterday I discovered MAF training through this video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_VNQ6UIbS8?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video is super inspiring because he actually runs a 3 hour marathon while recording!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already doing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/base-training-running/&#34;&gt;base training for my running&lt;/a&gt; which I discovered through the r/running Reddit. Here you focus on time instead of distance and do many runs on low intensity throughout the week, and one long run where you go 5 minutes more every week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Went on My First Camping Trip After Moving Back to NL From Norway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a nice week. I had an extra day off on Asenscion day and I decided to go for a camping trip for the first time after I moved back to the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great experience, and I wrote a couple of Tumblr posts with photos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tumblr.com/mischavandenburg/718093517925367808/first-trip-in-the-netherlands-part-1?source=share&#34;&gt;https://www.tumblr.com/mischavandenburg/718093517925367808/first-trip-in-the-netherlands-part-1?source=share&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>8 Simple Japanese Habits</title>

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through YouTube I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to quite a bit of Japanese culture and I love many aspects of it. I love this list of habits, and I was surprised to see how many of them I already incorporate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean the Toilet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many successful businessmen clean the toilet every day. It humbles you. Ajahn Chah also talks about this a lot. Check out &amp;ldquo;Toilets on the Path&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m also very focused on cleanliness and especially emphasize keeping my toilet clean. But I like the idea of cleaning it every day and I&amp;rsquo;m going to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;happiness-hedonic-adjustment-experiences&#34;&gt;Happiness, Hedonic Adjustment, Experiences&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a very good video. I can honestly say that I am very happy and content, and I lead a very fulfilling life. I do not usually watch this kind of &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; content because I&amp;rsquo;m already happy. But this video did give me some very important insights which have influenced the way I approach money and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Ran 10k For The First Time Today</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ran 10k for the first time in my life today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tumblr.com/mischavandenburg/717301155801235456/went-to-heemskerk-today-broke-my-running-record?source=share&#34;&gt;to the beach and back in Heemskerk&lt;/a&gt; on hardened forest roads, listening to the birds and feeling the spring sun on my face. I felt great and had a smile on my face most of the time. Lots of interesting thoughts popping up in the mind as I run and reflect. Hardly noticed that 77 minutes went by because I was having such a good time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Having Fun While Running And Exploring</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you would have told me 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, or even 3 months ago, that one day I would be 50 minutes into a run with a big beaming smile on my face, I would have never believed you, but today it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My base building schedule is giving me good results. I did this week&amp;rsquo;s long run this morning and it was 7 minutes longer than last week&amp;rsquo;s long run. I ran 8.5 kilometres in 67 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Power of Writing</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/power-of-writing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/power-of-writing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, writing. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the skills that I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently been praised for throughout my life. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good at it, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s because I enjoy it. It led me to getting an academic degree in English Literature and Culture, simply because I was following the things I was naturally good at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just like any other skill, you can only become better at it through consistent practice. This morning I read a wonderful little blog post &lt;a href=&#34;https://herman.bearblog.dev/on-writing-regularly/&#34;&gt;on writing regularly&lt;/a&gt;, and I was touched by his words:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Podcast Notes: Dopamine and Motivation - Huberman</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/dopamine-and-motivation/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;dopamine&#34;&gt;Dopamine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://hubermanlab.com/leverage-dopamine-to-overcome-procrastination-and-optimize-effort/&#34;&gt;an interesting podcast on Dopamine&lt;/a&gt; by Andrew Huberman. I always enjoy his content because he is completely driven by science, not by personal opinion. He is truly objective as far as I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is often misunderstood. It is not necessarily associated with good feelings after you pursue an activity. It is more related to motivation to engage in certain behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;rewards&#34;&gt;Rewards&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists did an experiment where they observed children of kindergarten age, and later reproduced this in adults. The children were monitored during school days, where they had blocks of structured time and free time. During structured time their activities were managed. They had to sing or write, for example. Then they had blocks of free time where they could do whatever activity they liked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exercise Stimulates Creativity And Motivation</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/exercise-stimulates-creativity-and-motivation/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/exercise-stimulates-creativity-and-motivation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed multiple times now that during my workouts my mind is generating lots of new ideas for coding projects or blog posts. It is a well known fact that walking stimulates areas in the brain that which will in turn stimulate creativity. But I&amp;rsquo;m noticing that it starts to happen with strength workouts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I don&amp;rsquo;t struggle with the motivation to get myself to the gym, I sometimes feel &amp;ldquo;guilty&amp;rdquo; for not spending that time on coding or studying. I&amp;rsquo;m realizing now that this is a very irrational train of thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I ran 5K for the first time in my life!</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/ran-5km/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/ran-5km/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I reached a significant milestone. I ran my first 5K!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been on the heavy side. I did a lot of weightlifting from age 18 to around 27 and I was always rather bulky, but very strong. This meant I was very good at working in the woods or helping people move house, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to do any running or endurance because my knees would start protesting very quickly. However, I always admired endurance athletes and I had the desire to be able to run more than a few minutes without feeling the urge to die on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
