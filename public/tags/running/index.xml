      <title>New Running Record! Ran 12km today</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New week, new record! For the first time in my life I ran 12 kilometers, and immediately another 10k PR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning it was time for my long run, and while I was drinking my coffee I decided to watch a running technique video again to see what I could improve. Lately I have mainly focused on my heart rate and steps per minute, but today I focused more on maintaining a better posture by sticking out my chest a bit more and leaning forward a bit more. The result was that I suddenly ran much faster and more relaxed without this resulting in a higher HR, and my steps per minute were also fine afterwards with 171SPM. These days I usually run around 6:30 but I’m really surprised that I was able to set both a distance record and a higher average speed without having to make any effort except constantly maintaining a better posture. “Running Tall” was the mantra that I kept coming back to when I noticed that I started to sink back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-i-learned-from-kipchoge-the-fastest-marathon-runner-in-the-world&#34;&gt;What I Learned from Kipchoge, the Fastest Marathon Runner in the World&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kipchoge is not only a world-class athlete, but also a source of inspiration and wisdom for anyone who wants to improve their life. I recently listened to an interview with him on YouTube, and I was amazed by his insights on running, success, pain, discipline and happiness. Here are some of the key takeaways and a summary of what he shared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Discovered MAF and Low Heart Rate Training</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/discovered-maf-training/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I was already doing something very similar, yesterday I discovered MAF training through this video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_VNQ6UIbS8?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video is super inspiring because he actually runs a 3 hour marathon while recording!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already doing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/base-training-running/&#34;&gt;base training for my running&lt;/a&gt; which I discovered through the r/running Reddit. Here you focus on time instead of distance and do many runs on low intensity throughout the week, and one long run where you go 5 minutes more every week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Ran 10k For The First Time Today</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ran 10k for the first time in my life today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tumblr.com/mischavandenburg/717301155801235456/went-to-heemskerk-today-broke-my-running-record?source=share&#34;&gt;to the beach and back in Heemskerk&lt;/a&gt; on hardened forest roads, listening to the birds and feeling the spring sun on my face. I felt great and had a smile on my face most of the time. Lots of interesting thoughts popping up in the mind as I run and reflect. Hardly noticed that 77 minutes went by because I was having such a good time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Having Fun While Running And Exploring</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/running-exploring-fun/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you would have told me 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, or even 3 months ago, that one day I would be 50 minutes into a run with a big beaming smile on my face, I would have never believed you, but today it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My base building schedule is giving me good results. I did this week&amp;rsquo;s long run this morning and it was 7 minutes longer than last week&amp;rsquo;s long run. I ran 8.5 kilometres in 67 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I ran 5K for the first time in my life!</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/ran-5km/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I reached a significant milestone. I ran my first 5K!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been on the heavy side. I did a lot of weightlifting from age 18 to around 27 and I was always rather bulky, but very strong. This meant I was very good at working in the woods or helping people move house, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to do any running or endurance because my knees would start protesting very quickly. However, I always admired endurance athletes and I had the desire to be able to run more than a few minutes without feeling the urge to die on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
