Introduction
When I did my English degree at University, exams were usually handwritten essays that needed to be done within a 3-hour timeframe. Sometimes we had multiple-choice tests, and I would always consider them a guaranteed pass because multiple-choice was much easier in my experience.
That opinion has changed since I&rsquo;ve obtained a few IT certifications. These tests are hard! I&rsquo;m typing this while sitting on the bus on my way home from my AZ-104 exam. I passed with an 860 score of 1000, where 700 or higher is a pass. But it was an astonishingly tough exam. Usually, I finish quickly and spend at least half an hour reviewing my answers. I had only 5 minutes to review my questions this time because I had used up all of the available time. The questions required intense concentration and were time-consuming because I needed to compare many options which were very similar to each other. There were no easy questions."><meta name=author content="Mischa van den Burg"><link rel=canonical href=https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/az-104-study-guide/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://mischavandenburg.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://mischavandenburg.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://mischavandenburg.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://mischavandenburg.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://mischavandenburg.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/az-104-study-guide/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-VLS3GJYW82"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-VLS3GJYW82")}</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/az-104-study-guide/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Mischa van den Burg"><meta property="og:title" content="Study Guide: AZ-104 Azure Administrator Associate"><meta property="og:description" content="TLDR It took me 80 hours of studying to gain this certification.

There were no easy questions.\nPreparation I studied 80 hours for this exam in a month. I work full-time as a DevOps Engineer, so I study in the evenings and on weekends. I have my Azure Fundamentals and CKA, but I only work with Azure occasionally in my current role.\nHere is what I did to prepare for my exam:\nGo through all of the Microsoft Learn modules for the AZ-104 Watch the entire AZ-104 study list by John Savill Practice exams on TutorialsDojo until I could pass them with 90%+ scores Microsoft ESI practice exams Microsoft AZ-104 Exam prep videos Microsoft Learn You really need to master all of the subject matter. Only completing the Microsoft Learn modules is not enough preparation. They are more like summaries. At the end of each module, they provide links to the documentation for the subject for further study. Unfortunately, Microsoft does not go easy on you. It expects you to know obscure details of nearly every service this exam covers. Therefore, I advise going beyond the Microsoft Learn modules and studying the linked articles after each module.\nYouTube AZ-104 Study Playlist by John Savill I’m not sure if it’s better to watch this playlist first and then do the Microsoft modules or the other way around. I did the Microsoft modules first, but for my next exam (AZ-400 DevOps Expert), I’ll start with the videos and then do the Microsoft Learn modules.\nTutorialsdojo These practice exams are excellent. I used them in preparation for my fundamentals exam.\nThe best thing about them is that they provide extensive documentation and explanation of the questions. So after you finish the exam, you can study a lot with these examples.\nESI Practice Exams You’re lucky if your organization participates in Microsoft’s Enterprise Skills Initiative. The practice exams provided in the ESI environment give you a good indication of what you can expect at the exam. I first did the Tutorialsdojo exams and then moved on to the ESI exams, and I was humiliated. The ESI questions are very complex and hard to solve, and I learned a lot from these exams.\nThere are 210 questions total, and I worked through all of them, and whenever I failed a question, I did a deeper dive into the question’s theme.\nstudying I take notes in Obsidian, and I use Anki for spaced repetition. I highly recommend keeping a deck of Anki cards and continuously testing yourself. You will need to memorize a lot of details. For example, you are expected to remember that storage accounts of the FileStorage type do not support Geo Redundant Storage. You can find my Anki deck in the GitHub repo.\nlinks AZ-104 Exam page with learning modules\nJohn Savill’s AZ-104 Study playlist\nGitHub repo containing my notes and Anki deck\nMicrosoft AZ-104 Exam prep videos\n","wordCount":"649","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://mischavandenburg.com/cloud-blue-logo.jpeg","datePublished":"2022-12-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-30T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mischa van den Burg"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/az-104-study-guide/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mischa van den Burg","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mischavandenburg.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mischavandenburg.com/ accesskey=h title="Mischa van den Burg (Alt + H)">Mischa van den Burg</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mischavandenburg.com/aboutme/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mischavandenburg.com/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mischavandenburg.com/archives/ title=Index><span>Index</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mischavandenburg.com/search/ title="🔍 (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>🔍</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Study Guide: AZ-104 Azure Administrator Associate</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 30, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mischa van den Burg</div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=tldr>TLDR<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tldr>#</a></h1><p>It took me 80 hours of studying to gain this certification.
