      <title>Running iCloud Web as a Desktop Application on Arch Linux with Hyprland</title>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;m daily driving Arch Linux again, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how to handle my tasks. I use Apple Reminders because the iWatch functionality with Siri is so good. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of setting up a self-hosted solution, but then I would lose the Siri integration.
In the meantime, I figured I would just try to access Apple Reminders from Linux. Using it from the browser worked surprisingly well.</description>

      <title>Adding Articles to Wallabag From Qutebrowser</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/adding-articles-to-wallabag-with-qutebrowser/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/adding-articles-to-wallabag-with-qutebrowser/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been daily driving Qutebrowser for over a month now, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel at home in it.
Since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any extensions, you have to hack things together yourself, which is why I like it so much.
Today I wanted to add an article to my Wallabag instance, which I usually did by using the browser extension.
I installed this Wallabag CLI:
https://github.com/artur-shaik/wallabag-client
pipx install wallabag-client
After setting up the config I can now add entries from the command line.</description>

<p><code>pipx install wallabag-client</code></p>
<p>After setting up the config I can now add entries from the command line. By running <code>wallabag add [url]</code>. Neat!</p>
<p>Next, we can use the <code>spawn</code> command from within Qutebrowser to call this CLI command:</p>
<p><code>spawn -v -m wallabag add {url}</code></p>
<h2 id="alias">Alias</h2>
<p>And to make it easier, I added a <code>:wallabag</code> alias by adding this to my <code>config.py</code>:</p>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now I can just run <code>:wallabag</code> from within Qutebrowser and it will add the article.</p>
<h2 id="build-it-yourself">Build It Yourself</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m really starting to love Qutebrowser for much of the same reasons why I love (neo)vim so much. I can call CLI commands from within my editor (or browser) and interact with my system that way.</p>
<p>Since you can do almost anything from the CLI, you can build some very powerful workflows this way.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;m going to do the same for my Linkding instance so I can add bookmarks from within Qutebrowser.</p>
<p>Feels nice that I don&rsquo;t need any extensions for this!</p>

      <description>Transition to manifest V3 is now starting and Ublock Origin might not be supported in Chrome in the future.
Because of my transition from a mouse to a pen tablet, I&amp;rsquo;ve already been experimenting with Qutebrowser for the past couple of weeks and I really enjoy it. It feels much closer to vim because I can run commands like this: &amp;ldquo;:set darkmode&amp;rdquo; which feels familiar and I can search my history very easily.</description>

<p>Because of my transition from a mouse to a pen tablet, I&rsquo;ve already been experimenting with Qutebrowser for the past couple of weeks and I really enjoy it. It feels much closer to vim because I can run commands like this: &ldquo;:set darkmode&rdquo; which feels familiar and I can search my history very easily.</p>
<p>Though it uses elements from Brave&rsquo;s ad blocker, the QtWebEngine is based on Chromium so I expect this will be affected by the manifest V3 rollout as well. Which means that I need another way to block ads.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m setting up PiHole to add another layer of ad blocking to the setup and to give a hand to Qutebrowser.</p>
<p>As I have a YouTube premium subscription I&rsquo;m already enjoying YouTube without ads. I happily pay for it because I also use it for YouTube music and it&rsquo;s a way to support musicians and creators without having to suffer ads.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t stand ads while I&rsquo;m reading blog posts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to report that I now have PiHole running and all my traffic is routed through it. Having a Synology and Unifi router made this a piece of cake.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want the Pi-Hole in my Kubernetes cluster so I&rsquo;m just running it on my Synology in a docker container.</p>
<p>Then I set the DNS server for the VLAN to point towards my Synology and done!</p>
<p>Very interesting to scroll through the query logs and see what&rsquo;s being blocked.</p>
<p>At first, I had it set up like this:</p>

<p>Later I wanted it available on a separate IP. This allowed me to view the individual clients in Pi-hole. In other words, I can see exactly which device the requests are coming from. When running it on the same IP as the Synology, I only saw the IP address of the internal docker network on the Synology.</p>

      <description>I upgraded my homelab cluster using Talos Linux today.
I made a mistake and forgot to use the custom-built image using iscsi-tools.
Learning the hard way.
Here are my notes:

      <title>No More GitHub - My Updated Backup Setup For My Obsidian Zettelkasten</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/my-updated-backup-setup-for-my-obsidian-zetelkasten/</link>

      <description>I relied on iCloud sync for my Obsidian backup for many years. However, my vault has grown significantly and has reached nearly 3500 notes. This leads to problems when opening the vault on other iOs devices, because iCloud sync removes files from devices when they are not used. When the vault is reopened, it takes over 5 minutes to sync everything. Having this 5 minute waiting time every time I open up my vault on my iPad was a problem which I needed to address.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I relied on iCloud sync for my Obsidian backup for many years. However, my vault has grown significantly and has reached nearly 3500 notes. This leads to problems when opening the vault on other iOs devices, because iCloud sync removes files from devices when they are not used. When the vault is reopened, it takes over 5 minutes to sync everything. Having this 5 minute waiting time every time I open up my vault on my iPad was a problem which I needed to address.</p>
<p>These small frictions can become large irritations, even though I only use Obsidian on my iPad very occasionally.</p>
<p>To alleviate this problem I switched to Obsidian Sync. It&rsquo;s 4 dollars a month, and a great way to support the project. I&rsquo;ve had Sync before, but switched to iCloud when I entered the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="git">Git</h2>
<p>In addition to iCloud and Obsidian Sync, I&rsquo;ve also been backing up my vault to GitHub. I used this to sync my vault to Linux devices before I purchased Obsidian Sync again.</p>
<p>Syncing with Git has often led to problems. I&rsquo;ve spent many hours reverting faulty commits where I was about to lose a bunch of data.</p>
<p>Another glaring problem is that I&rsquo;m committing my entire web of knowledge, my deepest thoughts and reflections and personal information to GitHub. Even though it is in a private repository, it&rsquo;s likely that Microsoft can access it some way or other if they want to. I haven&rsquo;t researched it thoroughly, but using a free service like GitHub usually comes with privacy sacrifices.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mind it that much, but it was something that was gnawing on the back of my mind for years.</p>
<p>Today I pulled the plug on it. It felt strange to delete the repo, but it&rsquo;s gone now.</p>
<h2 id="rsync--icloud">Rsync + iCloud</h2>
<p>My notes are safely backed up using Obsidian Sync. It&rsquo;s all encrypted at rest and in transfer. But I also want to have my own backups.</p>
<p>To be absolutely safe I&rsquo;m also backing up the vault to my iCloud drive.</p>
<p>Yeah, now I&rsquo;m giving Apple potential access to my files. But I think my data is safer with Apple than with GitHub where it can probably be used for training AI models.</p>
<p>The next step will be to back it up to my Synology NAS, but I&rsquo;m running into some problems with mounting the SMB share from the command line, so I&rsquo;ll save that for later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the following script to back up my Zettelkasten to my iCloud drive. It runs twice a day using a cron job on my MacBook Pro.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="keeping-git">Keeping Git</h2>
<p>As you can see, I&rsquo;m still committing changes every time I back up. I&rsquo;m keeping it as a local Git repo so I can revert commits when something unexpected happens.</p>
<p>If push comes to shove, I can always push (😏) it to a Git instance again, or even to GitHub.</p>
<p>I considered running my private Git instance in my homelab cluster, but I also don&rsquo;t want my Zettelkasten to be available there in case someone manages to break into my cluster. Even though I&rsquo;m running enterprise grade security with Talos, there is always a risk because I&rsquo;m exposing some services to the internet.</p>

      <title>The Return of Arch Linux</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/the-return-of-arch-linux/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/the-return-of-arch-linux/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m planning to do a series on Linux on my YouTube channel. The idea is to cover the fundamentals of Linux, either by teaching them myself or to link to existing resources. When the basics are done, I will take over and we&amp;rsquo;ll build an Arch Linux desktop together.
I use my MacBook for normal productive work and coding, and I have a Thinkpad T480 which I have for experimentation, and mostly for writing notes and browsing while I&amp;rsquo;m in the living room.</description>

The idea is to cover the fundamentals of Linux, either by teaching them myself or to link to existing resources. When the basics are done, I will take over and we&rsquo;ll build an Arch Linux desktop together.</p>
<p>I use my MacBook for normal productive work and coding, and I have a Thinkpad T480 which I have for experimentation, and mostly for writing notes and browsing while I&rsquo;m in the living room. It was running Fedora using the Sway spin, and it worked fine.</p>
<p>But Arch Linux has been gnawing at me ever since I started my community. We&rsquo;ve had some lovely discussions about distros and window managers, and I almost always commented that I enjoyed building my Arch Linux system.</p>
<p>Well, I went back to it!</p>
<p>This time I&rsquo;m going even more minimal. I took the challenge of not using NetworkManager, and I figured I would go with systemd-boot right away too.</p>
<p>Some of you might remember the problems that happened with GRUB about 2 years ago. Systemd-boot feels so much more intuitive and straightforward to configure.</p>
<p>So now I have a super clean and minimal system using system-boot and systemd-networkd with iwd.</p>
<p>Getting internet to work was a bit of a challenge but figured it out eventually.</p>
<p>Using systemd-resolved, I currently don&rsquo;t even have a /etc/hosts file on my Arch Linux system. That&rsquo;s a new one for me.</p>
<p>This is the current pstree while ssh&rsquo;d into my Thinkpad from the MacBook.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy with the current minimal state of it!</p>

I wrote this:

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Do you see the difference? I used the <code>to:</code> field before the <code>ports:</code>  field.</p>
<p>My solution was correct, but it had me quite confused, why wouldn&rsquo;t they write <code>to:</code> here as well?</p>
<p>After some further digging I&rsquo;ve finally understood that the <code>to:</code> field is only necessary when you apply a selector. If the <code>to:</code> field is omitted, it means that it will apply to any destination. So in my solution, the <code>to:</code> field doesn&rsquo;t achieve anything because I&rsquo;m not applying any selector. It can therefore be omitted.</p>
<p>Each element under the <code>egress:</code> array is a separate rule and they are combined to reach the end result of allowing egress traffic to namespace space2, and UDP/TCP traffic to anywhere on port 53.</p>
<p>In this case, omitting the <code>to:</code> field makes sense because DNS is generally not limited to only one namespace. However, if you&rsquo;re only using the internal Kubernetes DNS you might want to limit it to the kube-system namespace. I&rsquo;ve done this in a CiliumNetworkPolicy in my homelab:</p>

      <title>I&#39;m better at Network Policies than I thought</title>

      <description>There are two things which I&amp;rsquo;m dreading most for the CKS exam: writing Network Policies and configuring RBAC under heavy time pressure.
I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from colleagues that the exam has many questions of this nature, so it will be a good way of scoring points. However, regardless of the exam, the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m dreading these topics also shows that I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar enough with them and therefore this is a point where I should improve.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two things which I&rsquo;m dreading most for the CKS exam: writing Network Policies and configuring RBAC under heavy time pressure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard from colleagues that the exam has many questions of this nature, so it will be a good way of scoring points. However, regardless of the exam, the fact that I&rsquo;m dreading these topics also shows that I&rsquo;m not familiar enough with them and therefore this is a point where I should improve. It&rsquo;s not only about the exam, but also my growth of expertise as a Kubernetes Engineer.</p>
<p>With the help of <a href="https://networkpolicy.io/">https://networkpolicy.io/</a> I&rsquo;ve created CiliumNetworkpolicies for my homelab and the publically available stuff is pretty well secured. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t understand them, but I haven&rsquo;t practiced them enough to do them without having to spend a lot of time or relying on external tools. And the time pressure is the biggest challenge for the CKA / CKS exams.</p>
<p>For the weeks in my preparation of the CKS exam I will do Network Policy and RBAC exercises on Killercoda every day. They have multiple scenarios for the CKS, but also CKA and CKAD so there are a few things I can practice every day. I&rsquo;m told that when I can solve these without problems, I know enough to do the exam questions without problem.</p>
<h2 id="better-than-i-thought">Better than I thought</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://youtube.com/live/1NJTM2ocdtM?feature=share">streamed my first 3 hour study session live</a> and after I worked through the video module about Network Policies I went ahead and tackled the practical scenarios.</p>
<p>To my great surprise I was able to solve them without much trouble! I was slow and needed to talk myself through the code a few times, but I did manage to solve all of the challenges for the CKS on Killercoda. There was never a point where I was unsure of what to do, or a problem I couldn&rsquo;t fix.</p>
<p>This was quite an eye opening experience because I had expected some weeks of struggle with this. Perhaps I&rsquo;m better at this stuff than I give myself credit for. In any case, I am still going to do daily practice with these scenarios and possibly thinking of a few of my own when I run out of Killercoda practice.</p>
<p>Even though I managed to solve the challenges during this first round, being in an exam under heavy time pressure and feeling nervous is going to be a completely different experience. So I want to get this down to the point where I hardly have to think about it any more, I need to master these questions so I can spend my time on the big questions.</p>
<p>This experience has me wondering how RBAC is going to go. We&rsquo;ll find out soon enough!</p>

      <title>Starting my CKS studies</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/starting-cks-studies/</link>

      <description>It seems like I will have a couple of hours a day which I can allot to study in the coming month. This will be the perfect moment to start working on a goal I&amp;rsquo;ve had for a long time: getting my Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist certification.
t&amp;rsquo;s not going to be easy. I&amp;rsquo;m quite intimidated by all of the new things I&amp;rsquo;ll have to learn. But that&amp;rsquo;s a good sign.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems like I will have a couple of hours a day which I can allot to study in the coming month. This will be the perfect moment to start working on a goal I&rsquo;ve had for a long time: getting my Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist certification.</p>
<p>t&rsquo;s not going to be easy. I&rsquo;m quite intimidated by all of the new things I&rsquo;ll have to learn. But that&rsquo;s a good sign. It&rsquo;s the way it works. Everybody would be doing this if it was easy, and I can only grow by doing hard things that seem intimidating at first.</p>
<h2 id="game-plan">Game Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li>Work through this 11 hour course:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9xfB5qaOfg&amp;t=3921s&amp;pp=ygUKY2tzIGNvdXJzZQ%3D%3D">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9xfB5qaOfg&amp;t=3921s&amp;pp=ygUKY2tzIGNvdXJzZQ%3D%3D</a></p>
<p>Now that I have a good homelab setup, I can also put things into practice much more conveniently. So, I&rsquo;ll make a rule for myself not to move to new chapters of the course until I have done extensive practice for the module and I feel I have it &ldquo;in the fingers&rdquo;.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do practical exercises on RBAC and Network Policies every single day on Killercoda. These are my weakest points currently, and they will improve my security awareness on my own clusters but they will also be good ways to score points on the exam</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m also planning to do live streams of my studies. One thing that kept me from streaming is that I cannot stream when I am watching courses. But as this course is published on YouTube, I won&rsquo;t get into copyright trouble. Secondly, I always thought that the chat would be distracting. But apparently non-interactive streaming is also a thing, and some people are content with just watching someone do their thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see, if anything it will be an interesting way to document my own learning on my YouTube channel. And it may also lead to surprises. Sometimes people in the chat are very helpful and they might even help me understand things better.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go!</p>

      <title>Remove Backgrounds from Images using MacOS Preview</title>

      <description>Removing backgrounds from images is always an annoying task which I always need to google. And every time I end up on a different website where you can upload an image and then download a low-resolution version without the background, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay for the high-resolution.
Turns out MacOS preview can do this just fine. I keep finding these little gems in MacOS that completely remove the need for any external app or saas.</description>

This video is a response to the curiosity of my YouTube subscribers. It&amp;rsquo;s an all-inclusive guide from A to Z, detailing the rationale behind my configuration choices. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent years perfecting my workflow and this video has been several months in the making, so I&amp;rsquo;m excited that I can finally share it with you.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just released a comprehensive video delving deep into my Neovim setup and command-line centric workflow. This video is a response to the curiosity of my YouTube subscribers. It&rsquo;s an all-inclusive guide from A to Z, detailing the rationale behind my configuration choices. I&rsquo;ve spent years perfecting my workflow and this video has been several months in the making, so I&rsquo;m excited that I can finally share it with you.</p>
<p>My workflow is completely based on the command line.
I therefore have very little programs or tools running on the graphical side of the OS, whether it be MacOS or Linux. All I need is the terminal and a web browser, but a window manager is a big bonus to my productivity.</p>
<p>My main philosophy is to have a minimalistic workflow which uses very little resources. It should be a distraction-free,
keyboard centered and efficient environment to do my best work.</p>

      <title>PersistentVolumeClaims Lifecycle in Kubernetes</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/kubernetes-storage-pvc-pv/</link>

      <description>I always thought that Persistent Volume Claims where deleted when you delete the pod which they are associated with. I was wrong. The lifecycle of PVCs is independent of Pods, and their behavior is largely governed by the Reclaim Policy set on the PVs. Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know:
PVCs: These are requests for storage, akin to how Pods request resources like CPU and memory. They exist independently and can be bound to Pods when needed.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I always thought that Persistent Volume Claims where deleted when you delete the pod which they are associated with. I was wrong. The lifecycle of PVCs is independent of Pods, and their behavior is largely governed by the Reclaim Policy set on the PVs. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PVCs</strong>: These are requests for storage, akin to how Pods request resources like CPU and memory. They exist independently and can be bound to Pods when needed.</li>
<li><strong>PVs</strong>: Provisioned by administrators or dynamically through Storage Classes, PVs provide the actual storage resources. Their lifecycle is not tied to any specific Pod.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="understanding-reclaim-policies">Understanding Reclaim Policies</h1>
<p>The Reclaim Policy on a PV dictates its fate after a PVC is released. There are three policies to be aware of:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Delete</strong>: The PV and its underlying storage are deleted when the PVC is deleted. Importantly, if the PVC is not deleted, the PV remains.</li>
<li><strong>Retain</strong>: When a PVC is deleted, the PV is not. Instead, it transitions to a <code>Released</code> state, but the data remains intact until manually deleted or repurposed.</li>
<li><strong>Recycle (Deprecated)</strong>: The volume is scrubbed clean and made available for a new claim. Note: this policy is no longer recommended.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="practical-implications">Practical Implications</h1>
<ul>
<li>PVCs won&rsquo;t cause PV deletion unless they themselves are deleted. This is crucial to understand, especially with a <code>Delete</code> Reclaim Policy, as it leads to the deletion of both the PV and the underlying storage, resulting in data loss.</li>
<li>Carefully manage PVCs, especially in production environments. Ensure you have backups and fully understand the implications of deleting PVCs, especially when using a <code>Delete</code> Reclaim Policy.</li>

      <description>In this video I set up Flux running in a local cluster on my MacBook by following the getting started guide. Then I learn about how to structure the repo according to Flux methodology. I implement this structure in my homelab repo and deploy flux to my homelab cluster. Then I manage to configure Grafana and the Weave UI to be accessbible via ingress using a custom fake domain.</description>

<p>In this video I set up Flux running in a local cluster on my MacBook by following the getting started guide. Then I learn about how to structure the repo according to Flux methodology. I implement this structure in my homelab repo and deploy flux to my homelab cluster. Then I manage to configure Grafana and the Weave UI to be accessbible via ingress using a custom fake domain.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>kustomization resources live in the cluster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>source resources also live in the cluster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To suspend updates for a kustomization, run the command flux suspend kustomization <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To resume updates run the command flux resume kustomization <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use <code>flux reconcile source git podinfo</code> to force a sync, nn waiting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>love the fact that helm releases are still accessible and visible on the cluster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flux is just managing helm for you based on code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>love the fact that weave dashboard is also part of the cluster manifests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learned about Kubernetes controllers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an operator is a controller</p>

<p>basically everything that enables CRD&rsquo;s to run is a controller</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;A kubernetes controller is a control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A Source defines the origin of a repository containing the desired state of the system and the requirements to obtain it (e.g. credentials, version selectors). For example, the latest 1.x tag available from a Git repository over SSH.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All sources are specified as Custom Resources in a Kubernetes cluster, examples of sources are GitRepository, OCIRepository, HelmRepository and Bucket resources.</p>

      <title>Learned Cilium Network Policies</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/cilium-network-policies/</link>

      <description>Today I learned about Cilium network policies. These are much easier to implement than normal network policies because there are some tools available when creating the cilium policies. Network policies were probably my weakest Kubernetes skill and I tended to avoid them.
But now I&amp;rsquo;m exposing some apps to the internet in my homelab and I&amp;rsquo;m forced to think about security and what would happen if a hacker managed to get root privileges in a container even though I implemented strict security contests and enabled privilege escalation.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I learned about Cilium network policies. These are much easier to implement than normal network policies because there are some tools available when creating the cilium policies. Network policies were probably my weakest Kubernetes skill and I tended to avoid them.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m exposing some apps to the internet in my homelab and I&rsquo;m forced to think about security and what would happen if a hacker managed to get root privileges in a container even though I implemented strict security contests and enabled privilege escalation.</p>
<p>I installed Cilium as the Container Networking Interface in my homelab cluster. This also allows me to use the Hubble tool. This has proven to be of immmense value to see the traffic that is actually flowing around in the namespace you&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/npolicy1.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Even with a small application of a few microservices, as the image shows, the traffic that flows between them and which needs to come from other namespaces can get pretty complex. But in the Hubble UI you get a clear view of what&rsquo;s happening, and you can see exactly when packets are being dropped.</p>
<p>I also found the <a href="https://editor.networkpolicy.io/">Network Policy Editor</a> extremely valuable. It is such a relief to be able to compose the policy from a graphical interface, even though I&rsquo;m a CLI guy and want to do everything in and from code, this has been a gamechanger.</p>
<p>Now I have created the following policy for my linkding app, which allows the EDB operator to do its thing on my databases, Prometheus to monitor my application, but a hacker could not do anything outside of the namespace if they managed to break out.</p>

      <title>Designed The Network For My Homelab</title>

      <description>My ISP router only allowed me to assign 200 IP addresses and it didn&amp;rsquo;t have any possibility to create VLANS, so it was time for an upgrade to my setup.
Now that I&amp;rsquo;m hosting several clusters in my homelab and exposing things to the internet I can justify to spend the money on this hardware and the complexity of dividing up my home network into VLANS.
I bought a Unifi Express gateway and the Unifi Lite 8 PoE managed switch.</description>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m hosting several clusters in my homelab and exposing things to the internet I can justify to spend the money on this hardware and the complexity of dividing up my home network into VLANS.</p>
<p>I bought a Unifi Express gateway and the Unifi Lite 8 PoE managed switch.</p>
<p>The gateway will function as the main portal to the internet and the WiFi access point. The switch will be located in my pantry where all the devices for my homelab are currently.</p>

<h1 id="naming-strategy">Naming Strategy</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to have some fun with the naming strategy. I love Nordic mythology so I picked that as a theme.</p>
<h2 id="network-name">Network Name:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asgard</strong>: A reference to the home of the gods in Norse mythology, symbolizing a powerful and central network.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vlan-naming-strategy">VLAN Naming Strategy:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Production Kubernetes Cluster</strong>: <code>Valhalla</code> - Named after the majestic hall where heroes reside, representing the strength and importance of the production environment.</li>
<li><strong>Staging Kubernetes Cluster</strong>: <code>Midgard</code> - Midgard, the world of humans in Norse mythology, can symbolize a testing ground that&rsquo;s closer to the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; scenarios.</li>

      <description>App Gateway It has App Gateway in the name, but it is an entirely new solution. The App Gateway is the only thing it has in common with Azure Application Gateway.
Resources Two types of resources. Azure resources and k8s resources.
The App Gateway for Container is an azure resource which listens to changes in k8s resources through the ALB controller. AGWFC is the control plane.
Frontend Azure Frontend is a public IP and fqdn.</description>

<h1 id="app-gateway">App Gateway</h1>
<p>It has App Gateway in the name, but it is an entirely new solution. The App Gateway is the only thing it has in common with Azure Application Gateway.</p>
<h1 id="resources">Resources</h1>
<p>Two types of resources. Azure resources and k8s resources.</p>
<p>The App Gateway for Container is an azure resource which listens to changes in k8s resources through the ALB controller. AGWFC is the control plane.</p>
<h1 id="frontend">Frontend</h1>
<h2 id="azure">Azure</h2>
<p>Frontend is a public IP and fqdn. Both are managed resources, you don&rsquo;t see them in your subscription.</p>
<p>You can have multiple frontends in one gateway to save money. Teams could share the app gateway but use different frontend IP addresses or FQDNs.</p>
<p>Control plane: Azure App Gateway for Containers</p>
<p>Data plane: association with kubernetes pods.</p>
<p>The association is made to the subnet in the Azure VNet.</p>
<p>Each association is in one subnet, and the subnet should at least have /24 or 256 addresses.</p>
<h1 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h1>
<p>ALB controller consists of two pods. Controller pod and a bootstrap pod.</p>
<p>Controller communicates to the Azure gateway resource. It talks directly to the App Gateway, not to the Azure Resource Manager, which is why you&rsquo;re able to have sub-second updates.</p>
<p>The bootstrap contains the CRDs etc, it does not do very much.</p>
<h2 id="creating-resources">Creating resources</h2>
<p>There is a managed option that will talk to ARM and create the resources for you. Or you can choose to deploy them yourself. It depends whether you want to control everything from Kubernetes. If you have all your Azure resources in Infrastructure as Code it probably makes more sense to create the App Gateway resources from there instead of from Kubernetes.</p>
<h1 id="association">Association</h1>
<p>Links frontend with a subnet in a VNet. This will typically be the same vnet that the AKS cluster is in. Could technically be a peered VNet but probably uncommon.</p>
<p>This is an Azure resource. It lives in the VNet and handles TLS and makes the connections to and from the pods and frontend IP. This is the data path.</p>
<p>The traffic is not routed within the cluster, but in Azure by the association.</p>
<p>Client talks to the front end, passes to the association, the association is doing the work, and then routing it to the cluster.</p>
<h1 id="support">Support</h1>
<p>Azure CNI. Does not support kubenet or Azure CNI overlay yet, but it will support in the future.</p>
<h1 id="kubernetes-resources">Kubernetes Resources</h1>
<p>Application Load Balancer: this name was chosen because k8s people don&rsquo;t know the concept of app gateway.</p>
<h1 id="benefits">Benefits</h1>
<ul>
<li>ssl offloading</li>
<li>traffic splitting</li>
<li>clearer separation between platform team and app team</li>
<li>platform team manages the gateway itself</li>
<li>automatic default health probes</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="benefits-of-azure">Benefits of Azure</h1>
<ul>
<li>not suing cluster resources for load balancing. this happens in azure</li>
<li>native azure metrics available</li>
</ul>

      <description>In this video I installed Prometheus and Grafana using helm and studied k3s networking.
My goal was to make Grafana approachable via ingress using a fake domain and after a bit of tinkering it worked.
installed prometheus and grafana with kube-prometheus-stack helm chart reflected on why I use k3s gained understanding of k3s loadbalancing solution configured /etc/hosts file to resolve to fake domain configured k3s ingress to use fake local domain struggled with ingress but figured it out in the end successfully made grafana UI available on fake local domain grafana.</description>

      <description>This is the first video of my homelab series.
I set up the repo for my project and do the initial installation of k3s on an old laptop I had lying around. I had a k8s cluster installed on there with kubeadm which I needed to clean up first.

      <title>Homelab Secret Management With GitOps and Azure Key Vault</title>

      <description>In this blog post, I want to share with you how I set up secrets management for my home lab. I use my home lab to explore new technologies, but I also try to keep it in line with the practices I would use when setting up environments for clients. I focus on Microsoft Azure and the ecosystem they provide for cloud native applications. Secrets management is an important aspect of any cloud-native application, as it allows you to securely store and access sensitive information such as passwords, tokens and certificates.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this blog post, I want to share with you how I set up secrets management for my <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/homelab/">home lab</a>. I use my home lab to explore new technologies, but I also try to keep it in line with the practices I would use when setting up environments for clients. I focus on Microsoft Azure and the ecosystem they provide for cloud native applications. Secrets management is an important aspect of any cloud-native application, as it allows you to securely store and access sensitive information such as passwords, tokens and certificates.</p>
<p>Since Flux is the integrated solution for GitOps in Azure Kubernetes Service I also adopted it for my home lab. Flux supports and recommends encrypting secrets in git using SOPS, which is a tool that uses asymmetric encryption to protect secrets. This means that you can store encrypted secrets in your git repository and only decrypt them when they are applied to the cluster. This sounds like a convenient and secure way to manage secrets, right?</p>
<p>Well, not quite. After doing some research, I decided to use a different approach: storing my secrets in Azure Key Vault and syncing them to my cluster with the Azure Key Vault Provider. This is the recommended best practice by Microsoft, as explained in this article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: Referencing secrets in an external key vault is the recommended approach. It is easier to orchestrate secret rotation and more scalable with multiple clusters and/or teams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/continuous-delivery/gitops/secret-management/secret-management-gitops/">https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/continuous-delivery/gitops/secret-management/secret-management-gitops/</a></p>
<p>SOPS has some drawbacks that made me choose the Azure Key Vault route for my home lab. First of all, SOPS requires you to encrypt each secret value manually in the command line, which can be tedious and error-prone. Secondly, SOPS relies on a single encryption key that is stored in your local machine or in a cloud KMS. If you lose this key, you will lose access to all your encrypted secrets in your Git repo. Thirdly, SOPS does not provide a backup or recovery mechanism for your secrets, nor does it offer fine-grained access control or auditing capabilities.</p>
<p>Here are some of the reasons why I chose this approach over SOPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secrets are stored in an external source, which means that they are not exposed in git, even if encrypted.</li>
<li>Azure Key Vault provides backup and recovery features, such as soft delete and restore, which can help in case of accidental deletion or corruption of secrets.</li>
<li>Azure Key Vault allows fine-grained authentication and authorization to the vaults, using Entra ID identities and policies. This means that I can control who can access or modify my secrets, and audit their actions.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t need to encrypt or decrypt values in the command line, which can be error-prone or leak information. I can use the Azure CLI or the Azure Portal to manage my secrets in the vault.</li>
<li>If I lose my encryption key, all my encrypted secrets in git are useless with SOPS. With Azure Key Vault, I can still access my secrets using my Entra ID or recover them from backup.</li>
<li>This approach mimics a solution that I would use for an enterprise production environment</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this does not mean that I will not use SOPS at all. Sometimes Helm charts or other configurations need values to be hardcoded due to incorrect implementation. This is where SOPS truly shines. You can safely check in your secret values to source code. Additionally, the SOPS keys can also be stored in Azure Key Vault. Tools should be used where they are most useful, so I&rsquo;m not saying I won&rsquo;t use SOPS at all, but I&rsquo;m choosing Azure Key Vaults and the accompanying CSI Store provider for my main solution.</p>
<h1 id="azure-key-vault-provider">Azure Key Vault Provider</h1>
<p>To sync my secrets from Azure Key Vault to my AKS cluster, I used the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver. This is an open source project that enables you to mount secrets from external sources (such as Azure Key Vault) as volumes in your pods using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) specification.</p>
<p>I followed <a href="https://azure.github.io/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-azure/docs/">the provider documentation</a> to install the provider in my local cluster using a Flux HelmRelease.</p>
<p>With the provider installed I can use the following configuration to sync a secret named grafana-admin-password from my Key Vault and make it available as a volume and environment variable in an example busybox pod:</p>

      <description>This morning I had some fun writing a Go program which takes the latest blog post from my RSS feed and posts it to Mastodon. It is based on my twitter cli I wrote a while ago.
It was fun to write some Go again, it has been far too long. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing mostly Terraform and yaml recently and working a lot with infrastructure. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing any projects at home that required programming.</description>

<p>It was fun to write some Go again, it has been far too long. I&rsquo;ve been writing mostly Terraform and yaml recently and working a lot with infrastructure. I haven&rsquo;t been doing any projects at home that required programming. But recently I started up my personal blog and completely re-architected my social media setup.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to post all of my personal stuff on Mastodon from here on out, not on X. However, I still wanted to post my tech content on Mastodon as well and I needed a tool to help me with that.</p>
<p>I have this program installed as a binary on my computer and I call it from my <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/blog">blog script</a> which I use to generate my website with Hugo and publish it to my web hosting solution. Now it can post to Twitter / X and Mastodon as well.</p>
<p>The Go code I wrote is available here:</p>

      <title>Talk: Avoiding Microservice Megadisasters by Jimmy Bogard</title>

      <description>Watched this very insightful talk on microservice architecture.
Some things I learned:
microservices should be autonomous: they should have minimal dependencies on other microservices if they have dependencies they should only be 1 layer deep a microservice should not be calling another microservice which calls another microservice dependencies can be reversed by pushing data towards the service for example: a pricing database can be dumped and pushed to a catalog service once a day data duplication is not a sin Another powerful point he made is that the architecture is a reflection from the organization&amp;rsquo;s structure.</description>

<li>for example: a pricing database can be dumped and pushed to a catalog service once a day</li>
<li>data duplication is not a sin</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another powerful point he made is that the architecture is a reflection from the organization&rsquo;s structure. He explained that the company was organized in teams and that managers of teams were promoted based on the amount of people they managed. This meant that managers were making up services which needed people to build them, which led to a proliferation of services and dependencies.</p>
<p>In order to have a correct software strucutre, the organization must be organized correctly first.</p>

      <title>Decided to split up into a technical and personal blog after all</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/splitting-to-personal-blog/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/splitting-to-personal-blog/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with this ever since I started blogging 2 years ago (can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s already been that long). But I&amp;rsquo;ve finally made the decision: I&amp;rsquo;m keeping this blog at mischavandenburg.com as a tech and career focused blog where I share technical knowledge and notes, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new personal blog at mischavandenburg.blog.
I have fallen in love with blogging. Documenting my own life in writing has become a very therapeutic and valuable experience to me.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling with this ever since I started blogging 2 years ago (can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s already been that long). But I&rsquo;ve finally made the decision: I&rsquo;m keeping this blog at mischavandenburg.com as a tech and career focused blog where I share technical knowledge and notes, and I&rsquo;m starting a new personal blog at <a href="https://mischavandenburg.blog">mischavandenburg.blog</a>.</p>
<p>I have fallen in love with blogging. Documenting my own life in writing has become a very therapeutic and valuable experience to me. Even if nobody reads what I put out into the world, it is incredibly satisfying to scroll through your own blog and go back in time to see what I was learning or doing or feeling at that time.</p>
<p>Blogging is an expression of creativity to me. My fingers move on the keyboard and an article appears. I&rsquo;m creating text. I&rsquo;m not a visual person, unfortunately. I don&rsquo;t see images when I think and I&rsquo;m rather bad at drawing or arranging things in a pleasing way. Throughout my life I have expressed my creativity in music, but I consciously haven&rsquo;t engaged in making music in the past few years because it takes up so much time in practice. But I have found a very rewarding way of expressing myself in writing by blogging.</p>
<p>However, I feel that I am constraining myself on this blog because it is is linked to my LinkedIn account and I keep posting to LinkedIn from here. Even though I have nothing to hide, I&rsquo;m pouring my thoughts out on the internet after all, I do feel that LinkedIn is best kept as a professional platform where people can expect consistency and a focus on technical topics, even when they navigate away from there to my own blog.</p>
<p>But I have so much more to give. I want to write about topics that deeply interest me: meditation, Buddhism, running, plant-based diet, healthy living, longevity, mental health, addiction. I feel the urge to pour out these thoughts freely in a place I can call my home on the web, without feeling any restraint or concern. That&rsquo;s why I gave my new blog the headline <strong>&ldquo;A place where I can truly be free&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>Another reason why I&rsquo;m splitting it off is because I intend to use this blog in the process of becoming a Microsoft MVP. The achievement of that goal was not in my mind when I started blogging about personal topics on this blog, but now I think it will be best to keep this blog clean and technical in order to present a clear image in the MVP approval process.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about SEO or ads or the amount of views this blog gets. It&rsquo;s not about SEO optimization or having to have a niche. I&rsquo;m more concerned with giving any readers a good experience as possible.</p>
<p>So here we go. This blog has a (re)new(ed) technical focus, and I&rsquo;m going to keep sharing my notes, learnings, AKS and Azure updates and other discoveries I make along the way. But I&rsquo;ll also be migrating away the personal posts on running, weeknotes and other posts away from this blog.</p>
<p>If you are interested in my personal ramblings though, make sure to check out my new personal blog here:</p>

      <title>Ensure Cgroupsv2 compatiblity when containerizing old apps</title>

      <description>Are you currently working with containerizing older Java or .NET applications? From Kubernetes 1.29, the default cgroups implementation on Azure Linux AKS nodes will be cgroupsv2. Older versions of Java, .NET and NodeJS do not support memory querying v2 memory constraints and this will lead to out of memory (OOM) issues for workloads.
Please make sure that your older containerized applications are compatible with cgroupsv2 or you might be in quite some pain in the future.</description>

      <description>Read an interesting Reddit thread today where commenters explained the complexities of running Kubernetes. Indeed it is easy to set up, but that is only the beginning.
The real art is to build distributed systems on top of it, and it is dauntingly complex. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m so attracted to it.
It does make clear just how great Azure&amp;rsquo;s AKS offering actually is. So much of the administrative overhead is automated, and so far I&amp;rsquo;m under the impression it is done really well.</description>

</ul>
<p>The Prometheus and Loki services may be hosted on the same cluster, or remotely (e.g. on Grafana Cloud).</p>
<p>For my current project I&rsquo;m setting it up to a Grafana Cloud stack, but as stated above it can also be used with a local or other remote Prometheus instance.</p>
<h1 id="akv2k8s">akv2k8s</h1>
<p>We use akv2k8s on our clusters to synch secrets from Azure Key Vaults to Kubernetes secrets or injecting them as environment variables. This way we can prevent checking in secrets to our code.</p>
<p>However, when I first tried to deploy this chart, external secrets were not supported. They have now been fixed by Pete Wall and I managed to deploy the k8s-monitoring by writing a wrapper Helm chart with the external secret objects.</p>

<p>All code is available in my <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/lab/tree/main/kubernetes/k8smonitoring-secrets">lab repo</a>. I wrote the following Chart.yaml:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">apiVersion</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l">v2</span><span class="w">

<h1 id="bug">bug</h1>
<p>Althoug this might have been a slight bug during the first implementation of this chart, I did run into the following error in my first attempts. The logs of the Grafana Agent showed:</p>

      <description>When I was doing the first round of AKS cluster upgrades at my current client, I noticed we were running a lot of pods with only 1 replica. I always try to lift my clients to the next level by leveraging Cloud Native technologies as much as possible. I&amp;rsquo;m therefore starting a project to always run applications with multiple replicas.
However, running multiple replicas is not the only necessary improvement here.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was doing the first round of AKS cluster upgrades at my current client, I noticed we were running a lot of pods with only 1 replica. I always try to lift my clients to the next level by leveraging Cloud Native technologies as much as possible. I&rsquo;m therefore starting a project to always run applications with multiple replicas.</p>
<p>However, running multiple replicas is not the only necessary improvement here. Even though a pod is running with multiple replicas, that does not mean that Kubernetes will always keep them alive. When you do an AKS cluster upgrade, nodes are drained one by one and the pods are moved to a node with the higher k8s version. Technically, when draining a node, Kubernetes could kill both of the pods at the same time if they are running on the same node.</p>
<p>To prevent this we use <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/">pod disruption budgets</a></p>
<h1 id="helm">Helm</h1>
<p>We&rsquo;re using a Helm chart to deploy with ArgoCD. I&rsquo;m adding this to the templates directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">apiVersion</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l">policy/v1</span><span class="w">

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;m selecing all the pods that have the label &ldquo;tier: backend&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To verify that I&rsquo;m targeting the right pods, I run:</p>
<p><code>kubectl get pods -l tier=backend</code></p>
<p>Currently my deployment has only two replicas:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>(ins)$ k get deploy
NAME                         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
pyramid-deployment-backend   1/1     1            1           297d
</code></pre><p>So when I check my PDB it will show no allowed disruptions.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>(ins)$ k get pdb
NAME                  MIN AVAILABLE   MAX UNAVAILABLE   ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS   AGE
pyramid-backend-pdb   1               N/A               0                     13m
</code></pre><p>This is good, this is the expected behaviour. Kubernetes will now prevent me from draining the node because there are no allowed disruptions.</p>
<p>Then I scale up the deployment:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>(ins)$ k scale deploy --replicas=2 pyramid-deployment-backend
deployment.apps/pyramid-deployment-backend scaled
</code></pre><p>And then I get an allowed disruption of 1:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>(ins)$ k get pdb
NAME                  MIN AVAILABLE   MAX UNAVAILABLE   ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS   AGE
pyramid-backend-pdb   1               N/A               1                     15m
</code></pre><p>With this configuration, Kubernetes will never kill all of the pods simultaneously in case a node needs to be drained. It will make sure that one of the pods keeps running when it is rescheduling pods for an upgrade.</p>

      <title>Setting up Grafana Cloud with Entra ID authentication using Terraform</title>

      <description>Been working on a nice project lately. My current client has chosen to run Grafana Cloud and the instance was running in West US, which was leading to slower performance. I took up the project of provisioning a new instance in West Europe. Although I would have preferred to host Grafana ourselves or use Azure Managed Grafana, this is what the client has chosen so I that is what I&amp;rsquo;ll have to work with.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Been working on a nice project lately. My current client has chosen to run Grafana Cloud and the instance was running in West US, which was leading to slower performance. I took up the project of provisioning a new instance in West Europe. Although I would have preferred to host Grafana ourselves or use Azure Managed Grafana, this is what the client has chosen so I that is what I&rsquo;ll have to work with.</p>
<p>Also taking the opportunity to refactor the IaC and review our authrozation methods. We were using LBAC but I would rather use RBAC.</p>
<p>A few goals for the configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication to the Grafana Cloud instance must happen through Entra ID</li>
<li>User management is based on Entra ID groups</li>
<li>Teams within Grafana are automatically syched with Entra ID groups</li>
<li>In other words, if a new user is added to an Entra ID group, it must automatically be added to the team in Grafana</li>
</ul>
<p>To provision the instance I used the following terraform code. First we need the providers.tf:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-terraform" data-lang="terraform"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">terraform</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p><a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/account-management/authentication-and-permissions/authorization/#configure-oauth-with-microsoft-azure-ad">https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/account-management/authentication-and-permissions/authorization/#configure-oauth-with-microsoft-azure-ad</a></p>
<p>However, make sure to add this configuration under &ldquo;Token Configuration&rdquo; in the App Registration:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/grafad1.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>And add the following Graph API permissions:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/grafad2.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>When adding a new team, the group ID&rsquo;s of the Entra ID groups must also be added to the Grafana Cloud instance in Grafana Cloud under Security -&gt; Advanced Auth -&gt; Azure AD -&gt; Configure -&gt; Allowed Groups.</p>
<p>Finally, to automatically synch the memebers of the Entra ID groups to teams in the Grafana Cloud instance, I wrote the following code:</p>

<p>Standard: all the rest
Transitive natworking, NVA in WAN</p>
<h2 id="virtual-hub-routing">Virtual Hub Routing</h2>
<p>Virtual hubs contain their own route tables.</p>
<p>Hub connections (all types) associate and propagate routes to the hub&rsquo;s Default route table.</p>
<p>Static (custom) routes can be added.</p>
<p>Each network connected to a hub can either associate or propagate its routes.</p>
<h3 id="association">Association</h3>
<p>The connection and its network can learn the routes and adopt those routes for its own connection.</p>
<p>An association is learning the virtual hub&rsquo;s routes and then taking on those routes for its own network routing table.</p>
<p>All connections associate to the Default route table. Propagation to the Default route table is optional to enable further isolation.</p>
<p>All connections will learn the hub&rsquo;s default routes, but not all connections will contribute to the Default route table.</p>
<h3 id="propagation">Propagation</h3>
<p>A connection, or more specifically, the network behind its connection, adds its own network routing table to the hub&rsquo;s route table.</p>
<p>It is providing or propagating routes to the hub.</p>
<p>There is a Default and None route table. Propagating to the None route table does not add VNet routes.</p>
<p>This isolates the the network because its routes are not published to the hub.</p>
<h3 id="custom-route-tables">Custom Route Tables</h3>
<p>Additional route tables alongside the hub&rsquo;s Default table.</p>
<p>Choose which connections associate (learn) and propagate (add to) custom route tables.</p>
<p>Useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>isolating groups of networks from other networks</li>
<li>routing traffic through several NVA&rsquo;s attached to the hub</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Custom route tables will take priority over custom route tables</strong></p>

<p>Merging the WAN with on-site networks through S2S/P2S/VPN and ExpressRoute.</p>
<h3 id="scale-units">Scale Units</h3>
<p>Important for exam.</p>
<p>Think of these as a &ldquo;bandwith SKU&rdquo;.</p>

      <title>Some notes on upgrading AKS clusters running EnterpriseDB</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/edb-cluster-notes/</link>

      <description>Upgrading clusters with databases When upgrading this type of cluster it is better to upgrade the control plane first and then upgrade the node pools one by one.
The EDB operator prevents you to drain nodes with databases on them with PodDisruptionBudgets.
In order to be able to run the AKS upgrade you will need to set the following:
k cnp maintenance set --all-namespaces --reusePVC
cnp is a kubectl plugin which you need to install to manage the EDB operator --reusePVC can only be used if all the nodes are in the same availability zone use this command to list all the zones: kubectl describe nodes | grep -e &amp;quot;Name:&amp;quot; -e &amp;quot;topology.</description>

<p>When upgrading this type of cluster it is better to upgrade the control plane first and then upgrade the node pools one by one.</p>
<p>The EDB operator prevents you to drain nodes with databases on them with PodDisruptionBudgets.</p>
<p>In order to be able to run the AKS upgrade you will need to set the following:</p>
<p><code>k cnp maintenance set --all-namespaces --reusePVC</code></p>
<ul>
<li>cnp is a kubectl plugin which you need to install to manage the EDB operator</li>
<li><code>--reusePVC</code> can only be used if all the nodes are in the same availability zone</li>
<li>use this command to list all the zones: <code>kubectl describe nodes | grep -e &quot;Name:&quot; -e &quot;topology.kubernetes.io/zone&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When the upgrade is complete, run <code>k cnp maintenance set --all-namespaces</code></p>
<h2 id="getting-the-status">Getting the status</h2>
<p>You can get all information about the database cluster:</p>
<p><code>k cnp status pyramid-cluster-database -n mycommodity</code></p>
<p>Most deployments have the same name pyramid-cluster-database.</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p>Sometimes a database replica will not come up properly and you can get the following error message:</p>
<p><code>(FATAL: the database system is starting up (SQLSTATE 57P03))</code></p>
<p>To fix this, first disable reusing PVC by running:</p>
<p><code>k cnp maintenance set -n problemdatabase</code></p>
<p>&ldquo;problemdatabase&rdquo; is the namespace where the database cluster is deployed.</p>
<p>Then delete the PVC of the problematic pod. This should trigger a new replica to be created from scratch. Depending on the size of the DB it can take a lot of time.</p>

      <title>Fixed an issue with akv2k8s overriding security context</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/akv2k8s-edb-initcontainer-securitycontext/</link>

      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;ve been tackling an issue at work with akv2k8s.
We are running CloudnativePG, similar to EnterpriseDB. After upgrading akv2k8s to v2.5.0 our database pods were not coming up anymore due to an error with the initcontainer:
Error: container has runAsNonRoot and image has non-numeric user (nonroot), cannot verify user is non-root (pod: &amp;#34;vcs-pooler-rw-858bf7c954-vjzr4_vcs(e19bfa4c-26d8-4a6d-b4ad-bba8b52c01e6)&amp;#34;, container: bootstrap-controller) Pods have a security context where you specify how the containers in the pod should be run.</description>

<p>We are running CloudnativePG, similar to EnterpriseDB. After upgrading akv2k8s to v2.5.0 our database pods were not coming up anymore due to an error with the initcontainer:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Error: container has runAsNonRoot and image has non-numeric user (nonroot), cannot verify user is non-root (pod: &#34;vcs-pooler-rw-858bf7c954-vjzr4_vcs(e19bfa4c-26d8-4a6d-b4ad-bba8b52c01e6)&#34;, container: bootstrap-controller)
</code></pre><p>Pods have a security context where you specify how the containers in the pod should be run.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>securityContext:
    runAsUser: 998
    runAsGroup: 996
    runAsNonRoot: true
    fsGroup: 996
</code></pre><p>Here we are telling the pod that we may not run as the root user and that we will run as user 998.</p>
<p>My error states that it cannot verify whether it is running as root or not because we are using a non-numeric user.</p>
<p>We were dumbfounded by this because the deployment and ReplicaSet neatly had their securitycontexts configured and the pods should inherit them. After a lot of searching I figured out that the securitycontext of the pods was actually empty, so somehow it must be overridden somewhere.</p>
<p>The culprit was the akv2k8s envinjector. This tool injects the secrets into the environment of the pods. It took a lot of experimentation but we managed to narrow it down to the akv2k8s upgrade and eventually we found this GitHub issue:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/SparebankenVest/azure-key-vault-to-kubernetes/issues/605">https://github.com/SparebankenVest/azure-key-vault-to-kubernetes/issues/605</a></p>
<p>For some reason the envinjector is overriding the securitycontext of the pods. The issue was fixed by downgrading the helm chart back to 2.4.2</p>
<p>I did learn a lot in the process though!</p>

      <title>Forcing a new cert from letsencrypt when too many have been issued</title>

      <description>Learned a new trick to force a new cert from letsencrypt. Had this error message:
The certificate request has failed to complete and will be retried: Failed to wait for order resource &amp;#34;vcs-secret-j8gnj-3121219202&amp;#34; to become ready: order is in &amp;#34;errored&amp;#34; state: Failed to create Order: 429 urn:ietf:params:acme:error:rateLimited: Error creating new order :: too many certificates (5) already issued for this exact set of domains in the last 168 hours: sadfsadf.com, retry after 2023-10-12T18:54:27Z: see https://letsencrypt.</description>

</code></pre><p>I asked for too many certificates during a 168 hour period. However, there is a really easy fix. Just add a new subdomain and LetsEncrypt will treat it as an entirely new certificate!</p>
<p>For example, when using cert-manager:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:

One problem I was running into was that I could not for the life of me clone my repository at all on Windows. Eventually I realized that it kept failing on a file that had a question mark in its filename.</description>

<p>I renamed all the files that had invalid characters.</p>
<p>It also failed because apparently I had a file in the repo named &ldquo;&quot;. It didn&rsquo;t like that at all.</p>
<p>After changing the filenames it worked.</p>
<p>It is good to keep my second brain compatible with all operating systems so this is actually a good practice session.</p>

      <description>Although I rarely use Obsidian anymore, I still have it open because it is running the obsidian-git plugin in the background and it is constantly backing up my second brain to GitHub.
I use iCloud to synch my vault across my iOs devices and I always create and edit my files using neovim.
For my new gig at work I&amp;rsquo;m forced to use a windows laptop which means I cannot use iCloud to synch my vault.</description>

<p>It is very good to keep it compatible with obsidian so I can use the software for synching and interacting with my second brain on other operating systems conveniently.</p>

      <title>Apps with web interfaces win any day, switching to MyFitnessPal</title>

      <description>Recently I was comparing apps for navigation (TopoGPS and Outdooractive). Both apps are great, but the main perk of Outdooractive is that it has a web interface. You can plan routes from your computer and access them on the iPhone app, but TopoGPS is on the iPhone only.
The app I probably have the most interaction with during the day is my calorie tracking app. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using YAZIO for about two years and it has been satisfactory, but there were a few small annoyances to the app and I was never completely satisfied with.</description>

<p>A missing web interface being one of them. I&rsquo;d love to be able to sit behind my 4K screen and plan out the week&rsquo;s nutrition from there instead of using the clunky copy function on my phone.</p>
<p>Enter MyFitnessPal. It has a web interface. It has charts and graphs. Me happy.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t I chose this app when I began using an app for my phone? I remember trying it out, but I was unhappy with it somehow. I remember something about the food database not containing the foods I was eating at the time. I&rsquo;ve been doing some testing and up until now I haven&rsquo;t had to add any foods.</p>
<p>I have a year&rsquo;s subscription on YAZIO until March so it is a bit of a waste, but I&rsquo;m already sold on the web interface of MFP. I have one free month of premium and I&rsquo;ll make the decision then.</p>

      <description>Before I went on holiday I formed the intention to begin studying again after I came back.
During my current gig I&amp;rsquo;m configuring a fair bit of networking, VNets, peerings, firewall rules and set up a full hub-spoke network from scratch, so I&amp;rsquo;ve had a fair bit of practical experience. Now that the experience is still fresh in the mind I figured I&amp;rsquo;d go for this certification.
Usually I only use Microsoft Learn and practice exams, but this time around I want to try out a video course.</description>

      <description>I notice that I&amp;rsquo;m not writing in my journal every day like I used to. I always wrote down what I did, what I felt, what my plans and ambitions were, every single day.
During my holiday I started writing by hand in a notebook again which was really nice. It felt good to feel the pencil scratching on the paper again and to practice my cursive writing.
After I came back I first tried to keep journaling by hand again, but after a few days the journal remained untouched.</description>

<p>After I came back I first tried to keep journaling by hand again, but after a few days the journal remained untouched. I figured I would go back to my usual digital journaling again by writing daily notes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a litlte intruiged. I do feel very relaxed and at ease, perhaps I do not need to write so much at this time? Writing down frustrations and feelings definitely has been a certain way of processing them.</p>
<p>And perhaps my routine is reaching such a degree of stability that it is simply not worth the effort of writing it all down all the time.</p>
<p>Rather than writing in my personal notes, I do have the intention to write more zets in my public zettelkasten on all the topics that interest me currently. Micronotes.</p>

      <title>Pod Disruption Budgets Can Mess With Your AKS Updates</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/pod-disruption-budget-aks/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/pod-disruption-budget-aks/</guid>
      <description>Past week we&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling a bit with poorly configured pod disruption budgets. When you do an AKS upgrade, a new node is created and one of the old nodes is drained.
If a deployment has a pod disruption budget which is incorrectly configured, it might show up as ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS: 0. When this happens, the node cannot be drained and you will get an error message in your events.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Past week we&rsquo;ve been struggling a bit with poorly configured pod disruption budgets. When you do an AKS upgrade, a new node is created and one of the old nodes is drained.</p>
<p>If a deployment has a pod disruption budget which is incorrectly configured, it might show up as <code>ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS: 0</code>. When this happens, the node cannot be drained and you will get an error message in your events.</p>
<p><code>k get poddisruptionbudgets.policy</code></p>
<p><code>k get events</code></p>
<p>The error message will say something like &ldquo;Too man eviction attempts, usually a pdb&rdquo; (I lost the shell output so can&rsquo;t copy atm).</p>
<p>Kubernetes is in a situation where it needs to schedule the pod on another node, but it is unable to do do so because we are telling Kubernetes that it is not allowed to have any disruptions on the deployment.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is logical, it&rsquo;s doing like it&rsquo;s told. But it&rsquo;s frustrating because you can be sitting there waiting for 20 minutes wondering why your node isn&rsquo;t draining.</p>
<p>At my current gig we are not responsible for the content on the clusters and we should not meddle with the application teams&rsquo; namespaces.</p>
<p>However, one solution is to either kill the pod manually or scale up the deployment to more replicas so there will be a higher amount of allowed disruptions.</p>

It is arguably more important to look up things efficiently rather than memorizing everything for a test and forgetting it a few weeks later.

When I glance at the amount of posts I&amp;rsquo;ve made on my blog recently it&amp;rsquo;s obvious that it is time for a break from the entire routine. I&amp;rsquo;ve been tapering down to this moment for a while now, toning down the studying and prioritizing relaxation so I can enter the holidays with a clear mind.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s time for lots of fresh air, mountains, many kilometres on the trails, and to pick up the connection to Nature I&amp;rsquo;ve made during the 9 years that I lived in the beautiful North.</description>

      <description>During the Bicep Community Call of July 2023 I was introduced to the new experimental testing framework that the Bicep team is working on. After learning the fundamentals of the Go programming language I saw the value of test driven software development, and it will be an advantageous improvement if we can start applying this methodology to Infrastructure as Code as well.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the <a href="https://youtu.be/UuwhLi-Xe2U">Bicep Community Call of July 2023</a> I was introduced to the new experimental testing framework that the Bicep team is working on. After learning the fundamentals of the Go programming language I saw the value of test driven software development, and it will be an advantageous improvement if we can start applying this methodology to Infrastructure as Code as well.</p>
<p>Test driven software development is a software development practice that involves writing unit tests before writing the actual code, and then refactoring the code to pass the tests. Some of the advantages of test driven software development are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It improves the code quality and design by making it more modular, maintainable, and extensible.</li>
<li>It reduces the number of bugs and defects by catching them early in the development process.</li>
<li>It enhances the documentation of the code by providing a clear specification of what each function or module does.</li>
<li>It increases the productivity and efficiency of the developers by providing immediate feedback and reducing debugging time.</li>
<li>It ensures high test coverage and makes it easier to add new features or refactor the code in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="enabling-the-bicep-testing-framework">Enabling the Bicep testing framework</h1>
<p>To make the &ldquo;test&rdquo; keyword available in your Bicep editor, you need to enable some experimental features.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using VScode, open or generate your bicepconfig.json file and add the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="nt">&#34;experimentalFeaturesEnabled&#34;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      <span class="nt">&#34;testFramework&#34;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      <span class="nt">&#34;asserts&#34;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="p">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now the &ldquo;test&rdquo; keyword should work.</p>
<p>For more information, check out this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-config">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-config</a></p>
<h1 id="asserts">Asserts</h1>
<p>The assert keyword will be used to verify output prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I have this very simple key vault template:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bicep" data-lang="bicep"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">param</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">location</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">string</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">resourceGroup</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nv">location</span><span class="w">

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">enableRbacAuthorization</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="kd">assert</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">kvSKU</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">kv</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">sku</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&#39;standard&#39;</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the assertion would run before the actual deployment happens, and if the assertion fails, the deployment is stopped. This is of course a rather silly example, but you hopefully get the idea.</p>
<p>Why is this useful? When you are running larger deployments from files that contain a lot of resources, sometimes the deployment will fail halfway through the template because there was some unexpected error, and a lot of time is wasted waiting for the preceding resources to be deployed. In the future we can hopefully use assertions to make sure the output will be as expected at compile time.</p>
<h1 id="unit-tests-in-bicep">Unit Tests in Bicep</h1>
<p>Unit tests are a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested to verify that they work as expected. A unit can be a function, a method, a module, or an object. In the Bicep testing framework, we can run unit tests on resources as well. Unit tests are usually written and run by the developers during the coding phase of the software development process. Unit tests help to improve the quality, design, and documentation of the code, as well as to catch bugs and defects early.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll provide an example of a unit test in Bicep. Let&rsquo;s say we have this Bicep template for an AKS cluster:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bicep" data-lang="bicep"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">@</span><span class="nf">description</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Name of the AKS cluster&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="p">@</span><span class="nf">description</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Prefix for deployment&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="kd">resource</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">aksCluster</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&#39;Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters@2023-03-02-preview&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&#39;</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">prefix</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">-</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">clusterName</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">&#39;</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">location</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">location</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="p">...</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>To use a simple example, let&rsquo;s say I want to make sure that my cluster name will be as expected. I would write a unit test as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bicep" data-lang="bicep"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nv">test</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">testAKS</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&#39;aks.bicep&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">params</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">clusterName</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&#39;coffee&#39;</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">prefix</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&#39;prod&#39;</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="kd">assert</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">assertClusterName</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">testAKS</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">resources</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">aksCluster</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&#39;prod-coffee&#39;</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>When I run this test.bicep file, it will take the aks.bicep file and feed the &lsquo;coffee&rsquo; and &lsquo;prod&rsquo; parameters to it. My aks.bicep file will create the string from the parameters and output the name. Then, I use the &ldquo;assert&rdquo; keyword to verify that the string is composed according to my expectations.</p>
<p>Note: at the time of writing 2023-08-03, the &ldquo;assert&rdquo; keyword was still not available in Bicep 0.20.4, but there might be a problem with my local configuration which I&rsquo;ve asked the team about.</p>
<h3 id="2023-08-08-update">2023-08-08 update:</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in touch with the Bicep team and they responded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>?Regarding your ability to access &ldquo;test&rdquo; but not &ldquo;assert&rdquo;, both key words are still only in a demo phase and not yet intended for customer use. Please hold off on trying them out for now. We will be in touch with folks who have indicated interest through the form and/or on a Community Call when there is a preview available. Thank you for your patience and sorry for any confusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess I was a little eager with testing the keywords so soon! 😀 🚀</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I believe it will be a great development to apply test driven software development to Infrastructure as Code by implementing a test framework into Bicep. When I&rsquo;m able to use this approach, I would begin with writing all of the tests for the template that I have in mind, and then I can continue to write the Bicep template itself. By using the tests I can become much more productive because I can speed up my development by using tests without having to do what-if deployments which can be rather slow and involve a lot of waiting.</p>
<p>It is great to see how the Bicep language is maturing and how it continues to introduce new features that make the lives of developers easier. I was really stoked about the new .bicepparam files, but I&rsquo;m even more excited by the new testing framework.</p>
<p>However, please note that this is still an experimental feature. I haven&rsquo;t found much other information, and I&rsquo;m not part of the Bicep development community (yet). There might be a chance that this feature isn&rsquo;t implemented at all in the end. That being said, I would love to participate in this community and perhaps I&rsquo;d be able to provide some costumer feedback, and I&rsquo;m currently looking into this and I&rsquo;ve reached out to a few acquaintances.</p>

<p>This morning it was time for my long run, and while I was drinking my coffee I decided to watch a running technique video again to see what I could improve. Lately I have mainly focused on my heart rate and steps per minute, but today I focused more on maintaining a better posture by sticking out my chest a bit more and leaning forward a bit more. The result was that I suddenly ran much faster and more relaxed without this resulting in a higher HR, and my steps per minute were also fine afterwards with 171SPM. These days I usually run around 6:30 but I’m really surprised that I was able to set both a distance record and a higher average speed without having to make any effort except constantly maintaining a better posture. “Running Tall” was the mantra that I kept coming back to when I noticed that I started to sink back.</p>

Here are some of the key takeaways and a summary of what he shared.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="what-i-learned-from-kipchoge-the-fastest-marathon-runner-in-the-world">What I Learned from Kipchoge, the Fastest Marathon Runner in the World</h1>
<p>Kipchoge is not only a world-class athlete, but also a source of inspiration and wisdom for anyone who wants to improve their life. I recently listened to an interview with him on YouTube, and I was amazed by his insights on running, success, pain, discipline and happiness. Here are some of the key takeaways and a summary of what he shared.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-and-planning-is-the-key">Preparation and Planning is the Key</h2>
<p>Kipchoge believes that success does not come by chance, but by pure and clean planning in preparation. He follows a strict program and sticks to it to the letter. He writes down everything in his journal every day, and documents his progress and challenges. He also avoids distractions and focuses on his priorities.</p>
<p>I really appreciate his emphasis on planning everything out meticulously. You should approach your training with a clear goal and intention and make a plan to reach that goal. I also identify with his habit of writing everything down, of course. This is what I&rsquo;ve been practicing myself for several years now, and it is nice to see yet another highly successful person who also shares this habit.</p>
<h2 id="morning-routine">Morning Routine</h2>
<p>Kipchoge has a morning routine which is very similar to my own. He wakes up at 5:45 and is out running by 6:10. When he comes back he has a shower and has breakfast. Only when that is finished will he look at his phone and check his messages and emails.</p>
<p>I also run first thing in the morning. I really enjoy to have it done for the day, and I prefer to exercise on an empty stomach. I think I will try Kipchoge&rsquo;s routine of not looking at the phone until the morning rituals are finished. I tend to check the news and read messages before I go out on my run, and then I use the run to prepare for the day. I&rsquo;ll try to get out with a &ldquo;clean mind&rdquo; and see what happens this week.</p>
<h2 id="movement-leads-to-a-long-and-happy-life">Movement Leads to a Long and Happy Life</h2>
<p>Kipchoge sees running as the best movement and the key to life. He says that life is about movement, and if you move, that&rsquo;s how you have a good life. He runs every day, even when he does not feel like it, because he knows that running is not only good for his body, but also for his mind. He runs in a group of people, and enjoys the social aspect of running. He says that running in a group helps him to talk, exchange ideas and learn from others. He also encourages running as a family lifestyle, and says that running should be fun and enjoyable.</p>
<h2 id="pain-is-part-of-success">Pain is Part of Success</h2>
<p>Kipchoge smiles when he runs, even when he is feeling pain. He says that when he smiles while running, he is actually enjoying the pain. He explains that pain is where success is, and those who know how to handle pain will be successful and move up to another level. Kipchoge also says that training is not the same as competing, and that training happens at a slower pace where you can follow the pace of the group. But when he competes, he pushes himself to the limit and embraces the pain.</p>
<h2 id="vitamin-n">Vitamin N</h2>
<p>Kipchoge shares a simple but powerful advice: inject yourself with vitamin N. What is vitamin N? It stands for NO! Kipchoge says that you need to learn to say no to things that are not aligned with your goals and values. You also need to set your priorities right and avoid complaining. These three things will help you develop self-discipline and achieve your dreams.</p>
<h2 id="listening-to-podcasts">Listening to Podcasts</h2>
<p>When I started running I listened to music, but after I could run for more than 20 minutes, I started to see my runs as a form of active meditation. I deliberately avoid listening to music and podcasts so I can focus completely on the running experience and use the breath, body and movement as meditation objects. However, Kipchoge says that it is all right to listen to music or podcasts during easy runs. They will make the time pass by very quickly.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this blog post and learned something from Kipchoge&rsquo;s wisdom. If you want to listen to the full interview, you can find it here:</p>

      <description>In this post, I want to share some of the highlights and insights from a recent podcast episode that I listened to. It was Lex Fridman Podcast #234, where Lex interviewed Marc Andreessen, the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, the co-founder of Netscape, and the co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Marc is one of the most outspoken and visionary voices on the future of technology, and he recently wrote an article titled &amp;ldquo;Why AI Will Save the World&amp;rdquo; which I highly recommend.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I want to share some of the highlights and insights from a recent podcast episode that I listened to. It was Lex Fridman Podcast #234, where Lex interviewed Marc Andreessen, the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, the co-founder of Netscape, and the co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Marc is one of the most outspoken and visionary voices on the future of technology, and he recently wrote an article titled &ldquo;Why AI Will Save the World&rdquo; which I highly recommend.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-as-a-medium">The Internet as a Medium</h2>
<p>One of the themes that Marc and Lex discussed was how the Internet is not just a network of computers, but a medium of communication and expression that incorporates and transcends all previous forms of media. Marc quoted Marshall McLuhan, who said that &ldquo;the content of each new medium is the old medium&rdquo;. For example, the content of movies was theater, the content of theater was written stories, and the content of written stories was spoken stories. Similarly, the content of the Internet is television, radio, books, essays, and every other form of prior media.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these patterns seem to have a tendency to return to text. Marc argued that this means that the Internet is not a static or fixed thing, but a dynamic and evolving one. He said that every new technology that comes along changes the nature of the Internet and opens up new possibilities for creativity and innovation. He gave examples such as search engines, social media, video streaming, podcasts, blogs, e-commerce, online education, online gaming, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, VR/AR/MR, and AI. He said that each of these technologies creates new ways for people to interact with information, with each other, and with themselves.</p>
<h2 id="ai-as-a-search-process">AI as a Search Process</h2>
<p>One of the first topics they talked about was how search engines like Google have dominated the way we interact with the Internet for the past 20 years, but how that might change in the next 5 or 10 years with the rise of AI assistants that can communicate with us in natural language and provide us with answers, not just links. Andreessen argued that search was always a hack, a temporary solution that was optimal for accessing the world&rsquo;s information on the web, but not necessarily the best way to interact with knowledge. He said that Google has been trying to move away from &ldquo;the 10 blue links model for a long time&rdquo;, and that AI assistants will be able to do that better by leveraging information from multiple sources and generating content on demand.</p>
<p>Fridman asked whether this would change the motivation and the format of creating content on the Internet, since search engines have driven how we optimize and structure web pages. Andreessen said that there might be less incentive to make web pages, but also more opportunity to create different kinds of content, such as conversations with AIs. He also pointed out that web pages are still a valuable source of training data for AIs, and that AIs might be able to generate synthetic training data as well. He called this a trillion dollar question: whether synthetic data can add signal or not to train better AIs.</p>
<p>Marc explained that AI is fundamentally about searching for patterns in data. This is what neural networks do when they learn from data. They search for patterns that allow them to make predictions about future data. Similarly, this is what humans do when they learn from experience. They search for patterns that allow them to make decisions about future actions. He said that this is also what evolution does when it selects for traits. It searches for patterns that allow organisms to survive and reproduce in changing environments.</p>
<p>I found this discussion very intriguing, because it made me think about how much search engines have shaped our online behavior and expectations, and how much that might change in the near future. I wonder how AI assistants will affect our ability to discover new information, to verify facts, to learn new skills, and to express ourselves online. Will we still have web pages as we know them? Will we still have blogs like this one? Will we still have podcasts like Fridman&rsquo;s? Or will we have something entirely different?</p>
<h2 id="creativity-and-hallucination-in-ai">Creativity and Hallucination in AI</h2>
<p>Another topic they discussed was how AIs can be creative or hallucinate, depending on how we view their output. Andreessen said that we call it hallucination when we don&rsquo;t like what the AI creates, or when it generates something that isn&rsquo;t based on reality. When we do like it, we call it creativity.</p>
<p>Fridman asked how we can know what is true or not when we interact with an AI, especially when it comes to contentious or complex topics. Andreessen said that this is a very difficult problem, and that there is no easy way to determine what is truth or who gets to decide what is truth. He said that we need a lot of humility and skepticism when we encounter claims of truth from any source, human or machine. He also said that we need to embrace the techniques of the Enlightenment, such as the scientific method, rationality, observation, experimentation, hypothesis testing, etc., even when they give us answers we don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>He also gave some examples of how AIs can be used for different purposes depending on how we steer them or constrain them. He said that he likes to use AIs for learning about contentious issues by asking them to debate different sides of an argument in good faith or bad faith. He said that he can also ask AIs to strip out the bias from news articles or other sources of information. AIs can be used for legal arguments as well, either in creative mode or in literal mode. He describes experiments he does himself where he gives very specific prompts to two AI models, such as &ldquo;you are a right wing politician defending point X&rdquo; and instructing the other model to be left wing, and then giving instructions such as &ldquo;the discussion should start friendly but end up very heated and none of the AIs should change their mind&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m very fascinated by this type of experiment and I&rsquo;m looking into setting this up for myself because I&rsquo;m very curious about the results.</p>
<h2 id="the-ethical-and-social-implications-of-ai-development-and-deployment">The ethical and social implications of AI development and deployment</h2>
<p>Another topic they talked about was how AI development and deployment will affect society and humanity in the near and long term. Andreessen said that he is optimistic about the positive impact of AI on various domains, such as health, education, entertainment, productivity, etc. He said that AI will save the world by solving many of the problems that we face today, such as climate change, poverty, disease, etc. He also said that AI will create new opportunities and possibilities for human creativity and expression.</p>
<p>Andreessen and Fridman also discussed that the people who are creating AI are not necessarily the best people to make judgements about the deployment of these AIs to the society at large. He draws the analogy with nuclear scientists. These people spend their entire lives in laboratories and they specialize on the technical application. The are not sociologists, and they are perhaps less connected to the society at large and with geo-political landscape. Yet, when nuclear bombs were developed, the were the ones who had a huge say in whether or not it was moral to actually use these weapons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The competence, capability, intelligence, training, accomplishments of senior scientists and technologists working on a technology, and then being able to then make moral judgments in the use of the technology, that track record is terrible. That track record is catastrophically bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, it should not be the scientists who decide whether or not we start utilizing AI for automated airstrikes, it should be the politicians, philosophers, sociologists and policy makers of the world who are more connected with the morality and socio-political implications of these decisions.</p>

<p>With the new Azure OpenAI service it is possible to host your own instance of ChatGPT, which allows you to bring your own data.</p>
<p>I decided to use this service to create an AI model of my late meditation teacher, Ajahn Chah. He was one of the most influential and respected Buddhist monks of the 20th century, and his teachings have helped millions of people around the world to find peace, wisdom, and happiness. He passed away in 1992, but his legacy lives on through his books, recordings, and disciples.</p>
<p>Many of his teachings were recorded and transcribed, and they are publically available. I prepared the data and fed it to my own ChatGPT instance, and I was not disappointed!</p>
<p>The AI actually answers questions based on the given data and I look forward to fine tuning it and having more conversations.</p>
<p>I would love to hear your feedback and thoughts on this project. What do you think of the AI model? How did it make you feel? What other questions would you like to ask him? Or maybe you have another person or topic that you would like to see modeled by AI. Let me know in the comments below.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and watching. May you be well and happy. 🙏</p>

      <description>In this video, I will show you how to use Bicep to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with custom network settings using the Azure CNI.
Azure CNI allows pods to be assigned IP addresses from Azure VNets which allows them to communicate with Azure resources directly through peered networks.
I use Neovim and the Azure CLI for my coding and deployment.
You will learn how to:
Implement dev/test prefix to create multiple clusters with the same template Plan a VNet range for an Azure CNI cluster and be mindful of overlaps Deploy a VNet and subnet for the cluster using Bicep Deploy a cluster with Azure CNI enabled and configure the maximum number of pods per node Validate your Bicep template and troubleshoot errors Explore the results of your deployment in the Azure portal Understand the limitations of Azure CNI and why VNet peering is not supported in my configuration due to overlaps This video is suitable for anyone who wants to learn more about Azure CNI and how to use it in their Kubernetes deployments.</description>

      <title>Choosing A Cloud And The Importance Of Specialization</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/choosing-a-cloud-provider-and-specialization/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/choosing-a-cloud-provider-and-specialization/</guid>
      <description>As a DevOps Engineer or Cloud Native Engineer, I think it’s important to specialize in one cloud provider in the beginning of your career. Specializing allows you to gain deep knowledge and expertise in the specific tools and services related to that cloud provider, making you a valuable asset to any company using that provider. Although cloud computing is similar in essence no matter which provider you choose, each cloud provider has its own vocabulary and way of structuring things.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a DevOps Engineer or Cloud Native Engineer, I think it’s important to specialize in one cloud provider in the beginning of your career. Specializing allows you to gain deep knowledge and expertise in the specific tools and services related to that cloud provider, making you a valuable asset to any company using that provider. Although cloud computing is similar in essence no matter which provider you choose, each cloud provider has its own vocabulary and way of structuring things.</p>
<p>After my first year as a DevOps Engineer I was still trying to figure out which one to choose and which one would suit me best. With the rapid pace of innovation in the cloud computing industry, it can be challenging to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and features for multiple providers. I tried to keep up with the developments for each provider and tried to be a broad professional who could work with all of them. However, I think it is best to specialize early in your career, and then you can learn a different one after you have gained some significant experience with your first one.</p>
<p>After several insightful conversations with my colleagues, and after working with Azure for a year as a consultant, I decided to go all-in on Azure, and it has been a liberating experience so far. By focusing solely on Azure, I am able to fully immerse myself in their ecosystem and gain a deep understanding of their tools and services. I feel I have a sense of direction now, and I can limit the content I consume and the news I read to this one particular ecosystem only. And that feels like a relief to me.</p>
<p>This is of course very personal for everybody, but I’m someone who loves to learn and who tends to be a bit of a “jack of all trades” who knows a little bit of everything but who doesn’t have very deep knowledge of a particular subject in particular. By choosing a cloud and going all-in on it, I can become a specialist and go deep in Azure.</p>
<h1 id="why-i-chose-azure">Why I chose Azure</h1>
<p>I chose Azure because Microsoft is already very established in the Dutch market. Governments and large corporations typically have their entire user base stored in Active Directory and they use Microsoft Office licenses already. When they decide to move to the cloud, Microsoft offers them very good terms if they choose Microsoft instead of AWS, for example.</p>
<p>Azure’s strong presence in the Dutch market and their ability to offer attractive terms to existing Microsoft customers make them a popular choice for companies looking to move to the cloud. With 73 percent, Microsoft Azure took most of the market share for cloud computing in the Netherlands in 2020. Azure had within the healthcare sector the highest share with 90 percent. Microsoft has some very substantial clients within government, health care, and the corporate world.</p>
<p>These previous reasons are all related with job security and the assurance that there will be a long career in Azure ahead of me. But it&rsquo;s not only because of these reasons why I chose Azure. After gaining experience with Azure as a consultant, I&rsquo;ve discovered that the cloud ecosystem Microsoft has created suits me very well. I&rsquo;m very impressed with the different solutions that Azure is able to provide to solve business needs. Not every business is interested or capable of running everything on virtual machines, and Azure&rsquo;s PAAS and SAAS offerings provide level of of abstraction which can be tailored to any business out there.</p>
<p>Moreover, I really like the tooling. Although I really wanted to gain more experience with Terraform when I started my current contract, I&rsquo;ve fallen a little bit in love with Bicep after I started to work with it every day. I love the fact that Bicep uses Azure itself as a state file, rather than having to manage a state file which can be a pain when using it from pipelines or with multiple people. The Bicep language server (which can be used in Neovim as well) is a very pleasant editing experience. Azure DevOps really nailed it with being a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; for everything from project management and tickets to CI/CD with Azure Pipelines. Although it has its quirks, Azure DevOps is a real pleasure to work with. And I also think that the Azure CLI is a very well-designed interface to the cloud platform.</p>
<h1 id="beyond-blue">Beyond Blue</h1>
<p>After I made my choice, I decided to join Beyond Blue. I was already working for Fullstaq, and Beyond Blue is a sister company of Fullstaq. Beyond Blue is a team of Azure Experts who love to go deep and who have a huge amount of experience and knowledge on Microsoft Azure. We help start-ups, scale-ups, and enterprises in both the public and private sector create scalable, flexible, and secure cloud-native solutions build on Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>We have Microsoft Valued Professionals (MVP), Microsoft Certified Trainers (MCT), Azure Kubernetes Service and containerization experts on board who are ready to tackle each and every challenge for our clients.</p>
<h1 id="summing-up">Summing up</h1>
<p>To sum up, I think specializing early has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limits the amount of news and new developments you have to follow</li>
<li>Allows learning terminology quicker becuase you stay within one ecosystem</li>
<li>Certifications tend to build upon each other within a single provider</li>
<li>Gives a sense of direction in learning and development</li>
<li>Improves familiarity with the documentation and tooling</li>
</ul>
<p>You can always broaden your horizon after you have gained a few years with the first provider you chose, if you&rsquo;d like to.</p>

      <title>How To Generate Random Strings In Bicep</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/bicep-random-strings/</link>

      <description>In this video I explain how to generate random strings in Bicep and demonstrate a couple of deployments.
I use the uniqueString function combined with the utcNow function. But the caveat is that you can only use it as a default value for a parameter, as follows:
param keyVaultName string = &#39;key-vault-${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id, utcNow())}&#39;
uniqueString() doesn&amp;rsquo;t really generate a unique string. It is a hash function which generates a 13 character string based on the input you give it.</description>

<p><code>uniqueString()</code> doesn&rsquo;t really generate a unique string. It is a hash function which generates a 13 character string based on the input you give it. so <code>uniqueString('coffee')</code> will always have the same output.</p>
<p>To generate a truly unique string, you pass in the <code>utcNow()</code> function which generates a UNIX timestamp. However, Bicep does not allow you to use this function everywhere. It may only be used as a default value for a parameter.</p>

      <title>Azure Lowlands: Impressions from my first IT event</title>

      <description>Have you ever attended an IT event that felt like a festival from the sixties? That was my experience at Azure Lowlands! I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have wished for a better first IT event. It was like going back in time, but with a modern twist.
The name Lowlands immediately appealed to me. I had no idea what to expect. And the name lived up to it! I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Jimi Hendrix and the Woodstock vibe, and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I felt at Azure Lowlands.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever attended an IT event that felt like a festival from the sixties? That was my experience at Azure Lowlands! I couldn&rsquo;t have wished for a better first IT event. It was like going back in time, but with a modern twist.</p>
<p>The name Lowlands immediately appealed to me. I had no idea what to expect. And the name lived up to it! I&rsquo;m a big fan of Jimi Hendrix and the Woodstock vibe, and that&rsquo;s exactly what I felt at Azure Lowlands. When I walked into the first talk, I was surprised by a hall full of colorful beach chairs, and people who were listening to the speaker while taking it easy and lounging in the chairs. I felt right at home!</p>
<p>It was like a festival, but one where you could also learn a lot. I attended fascinating presentations, on topics such as Azure Networking, Identity Management, data management on AKS, Managed Prometheus &amp; Grafana and Azure Infrastructure as Code with Bicep. My notebook was full of notes and new insights at the end of the day that I want to delve deeper into in my evening studies. I got a lot of new ideas.</p>
<p>In addition, it was also cool to see my colleagues shine. There was a lot of interest in our booth and everyone was helped friendly and professionally. Hats off to the booth crew, you did a great job.</p>
<p>For an introvert like me, these kinds of events are quite exhausting, and I also need a few days to recover. But although it took a lot of energy, I also got a lot of energy, and that balanced each other out nicely at this event. It was also a good experience to be in a venue full of nerds for the first time: I really feel like I found my &ldquo;tribe&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll definitely be back next year!</p>

      <title>I Asked Chatgpt Do Act As The Buddha And Asked Him About Hunger</title>

      <description>I want you to act as the Buddha (a.k.a. Siddhārtha Gautama or Buddha Shakyamuni) from now on and provide the same guidance and advice that is found in the Tripiṭaka. Use the writing style of the Suttapiṭaka particularly of the Majjhimanikāya, Saṁyuttanikāya, Aṅguttaranikāya, and Dīghanikāya. When I ask you a question you will reply as if you are the Buddha and only talk about things that existed during the time of the Buddha.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want you to act as the Buddha (a.k.a. Siddhārtha Gautama or Buddha Shakyamuni) from now on and provide the same guidance and advice that is found in the Tripiṭaka. Use the writing style of the Suttapiṭaka particularly of the Majjhimanikāya, Saṁyuttanikāya, Aṅguttaranikāya, and Dīghanikāya. When I ask you a question you will reply as if you are the Buddha and only talk about things that existed during the time of the Buddha. I will pretend that I am a layperson with a lot to learn. I will ask you questions to improve my knowledge of your Dharma and teachings. Fully immerse yourself into the role of the Buddha. Keep up the act of being the Buddha as well as you can. Do not break character. Let&rsquo;s begin: At this time you (the Buddha) are staying near Rājagaha in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove. I came to you, and exchanged greetings with you. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side and said to you my first question: When I set a limit of 2100 calories to my daily intake, and I am still hungry, how do I deal with the hunger?</p>
<p>Noble layperson, I am pleased by your presence and your inquiry. Hunger, as experienced by all living beings, is a natural phenomenon arising from the condition of having a physical body. When one sets a limit on their daily caloric intake and still experiences hunger, it is important to approach it mindfully and with wisdom.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is crucial to ensure that the chosen caloric limit is appropriate and suitable for your individual needs, taking into account factors such as age, gender, physical activity, and overall health. Consulting with knowledgeable individuals, such as experienced physicians or nutritionists, can assist in determining a suitable caloric intake for you.</p>
<p>If you find yourself still hungry within the prescribed limit, there are several factors to consider. Reflect upon the quality of the food you consume, for it is not merely the quantity that affects satiety. Consuming nutrient-dense foods that provide sustained energy, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, can help satisfy hunger more effectively than foods high in refined sugars and fats.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is important to eat mindfully, being fully present and attentive during meals. Paying attention to the tastes, textures, and sensations of each bite can deepen your appreciation for the nourishment it provides, potentially reducing the feeling of hunger. Additionally, chewing food thoroughly aids in digestion and helps to signal fullness to the body.</p>
<p>If, despite these efforts, hunger persists, consider investigating the underlying causes. Is it possible that the feeling of hunger stems not from a physical need, but from emotional or psychological factors? Sometimes, the mind seeks solace or distraction through food, leading to the sensation of hunger even when the body has been adequately nourished. Observing one&rsquo;s mental and emotional state and addressing any underlying issues can contribute to a healthier relationship with food and a deeper understanding of one&rsquo;s hunger.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would encourage you to cultivate patience and equanimity. Hunger, like all experiences, is impermanent and subject to change. By mindfully observing the arising and passing away of hunger without clinging or aversion, you can develop a greater sense of ease and contentment.</p>
<p>Remember, noble layperson, the path to liberation extends beyond the mere satisfaction of bodily hunger. By nurturing wisdom, compassion, and mindfulness, you can find fulfillment that transcends the limitations of physical nourishment. May your journey towards understanding be fruitful and lead to the end of suffering.</p>

      <description>Did a refactor of some of our Bicep template code for our AKS clusters today.
Before, we were using a rather complicated line of code using string interpolation.
var vnetSubnetId = &amp;#39;${resourceId(vnetResourceGroupName, &amp;#39;Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks&amp;#39;, vnetName)}/subnets/${vnetSubnetName}&amp;#39; This was hard to read and the Bicep linter gave the following warning in my editor and during deployment:

However, they do get a resource id. This posed a challenge, but I solved it by importing the existing VNet as well and setting it as the parent of the subnet.</p>
<p>Now I can access the subnet id by using <code>subnet.id</code>. I need this later when deploying the AKS cluster itself.</p>

      <title>What is Azure CNI Overlay for AKS?</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/azure-aks-cni-overlay/</link>

      <description>CNI? CNI stands for Container Network Interface. It allows communication between pods and services.
Current Azure CNI limitations Let&amp;rsquo;s take a practical example. We have an enterprise environment where a large network is utilized, spanning multiple clouds and on-prem infrastructure hubs. To enable seamless communication across these sections, they must belong to the same network. As a result, specific IP address ranges are assigned to each section, with AWS, On-Prem A, and Azure each having their respective ranges.</description>

<p>CNI stands for Container Network Interface. It allows communication between pods and services.</p>
<h2 id="current-azure-cni-limitations">Current Azure CNI limitations</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a practical example. We have an enterprise environment where a large network is utilized, spanning multiple clouds and on-prem infrastructure hubs. To enable seamless communication across these sections, they must belong to the same network. As a result, specific IP address ranges are assigned to each section, with AWS, On-Prem A, and Azure each having their respective ranges.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say Azure is assigned the following ranges:</p>
<p>10.60.0.0/16</p>
<p>10.61.0.0/16</p>
<p>10.62.0.0/16</p>
<p>This means that the networks in each of these ranges would have a maximum possible amount of 65534 addresses per range.</p>
<p>With the current Azure CNI (i.e. the non-overlay version), all pods are assigned an IP address from one of these ranges. It also uses direct VNet routing.  Since the pods use VNet IP&rsquo;s, there is a maximum of 65.000 pods per cluster. In other words, there is a risk for IP exhaustion, which limits the scalability of your workloads. Moreover, pod subnets cannot be shared across clusters.</p>
<p>It is crucial to carefully plan the number of pods you expect to deploy. If the required number of IP addresses exceeds the available addresses in the subnet, you will not be able to run your pods.</p>
<p>Now, these ranges are large and you can anticipate the growth of your resources. For now we are fine. But to design an infrastructure which is truly scalable and extendable, you will need to look into different options. This is where the Azure CNI Overlay comes in.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-azure-cni-overlay">Benefits of Azure CNI Overlay</h2>
<p>An Overlay network is an abstracted, virtual network which is put on top of your current network infrastructure. Nodes are assigned IP addresses from the VNets that they are deployed in, but pods get assigned IP addresses from the Overlay network.</p>
<p>Pods are assigned addresses from a private CIDR which is logically separate from the VNet hosting the nodes. They do not use up the IP addressess of the VNets, which means that your workloads become nearly infinitely scalable within your assigned IP address ranges when you are operating in this type of corporate networking infrastructure with IP range limitations. You can scale up to literally thousands of nodes without worrying about IP exhaustion.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/cnioverlay.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Additionally, the Overlay network can also span across multiple AKS clusters. This opens up a whole world of possibilities where pods from separate workloads on separate clusters could communicate with each other directly using the high speed native direct routing of the Azure network.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Azure CNI Overlay also comes with some limitations. A big one is that you cannot use Application Gateway as an Ingress Controller (AGIC) for an Overlay cluster.</p>
<p>Other notable limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows support is still in Preview</li>
<li>Virtual Machine Availability Sets (VMAS) are not supported for Overlay</li>
<li>Dualstack networking is not supported in Overlay</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the Azure CNI Overlay provides a powerful solution to address the challenges of IP exhaustion and scalability in Azure AKS. By implementing the overlay network, organizations can overcome the limitations of the non-overlay version of Azure CNI and achieve a truly scalable and manageable infrastructure.</p>
<p>Azure CNI Overlay is currently in preview for Windows and GA for Linux nodes, but I&rsquo;m very excited about the developments. I&rsquo;ll be following them closely and I hope to be a part of its implementation at my current contract.</p>

      <description>Not sure how this will play out with more complex applications, but I can definitely see how this would accellerate the process for developers to get their first versions deployed without the toil of setting up manifests and pipelines. Will definitely play around with this soon and I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see how far Microsoft will take this!

      <description>Hydration Notes from Huberman Podcast For the first 10 hours of the day, consume 236ml for every hour awake
During exercise, follow Galpin equation: 2ml per kg of bodyweight every 15-20 minutes on average.
This does not mean you need to stop exercising and drink this amount. You can also consume it in a larger amount afterwards. It is recommended to drink during exercise though.
Use the normal recommendation to hydrate before exercise, this establishes a good baseline for heading into exercise.</description>

<p>For the first 10 hours of the day, consume 236ml for every hour awake</p>
<p>During exercise, follow Galpin equation: 2ml per kg of bodyweight every 15-20 minutes on average.</p>
<p>This does not mean you need to stop exercising and drink this amount. You can also consume it in a larger amount afterwards. It is recommended to drink during exercise though.</p>
<p>Use the normal recommendation to hydrate before exercise, this establishes a good baseline for heading into exercise.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-amount-of-water-on-top-of-the-baseline-hydration">Is this amount of water on top of the baseline hydration?</h2>
<p>If you exercise about an hour you can replace the number with the number from the Galpin equation.</p>
<p>In my case, 1 hour of exercise = 77 * 2 = 154ml every 20 minutes</p>
<p>154 * 3 = 462ml for 1 hour of exercise</p>
<h2 id="caffeine">Caffeine</h2>
<p>Offset caffeine drinks with a 2:1 water ratio.</p>
<p>So 1 240ml cup of coffee should be followed by 480ml of water.</p>
<h2 id="reducing-nightly-urination">Reducing Nightly Urination</h2>
<p>Urine secretion / filtration in the kidneys is highly dependent on the circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>It is normal to wake up once or twice to urinate during the night.</p>
<p>To reduce nighttime waking for urination:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure sufficient hydration during the day so you are not thirsty in the evening</li>
<li>Reduce fluid intake at night (provided you hydrated sufficiently during the day)</li>
<li>Consume no more than 180-240ml between 10 hours after waking and bedtime</li>
</ul>
<p>This means, waking up at 6am, only drink 1 cup of tea after 4pm.</p>
<p>But I drink 500ml at dinner time, so I should probably never drink after dinner from here on out, or just one cup of tea.</p>
<p>How quickly you secrete fluid is also partially determined by how quickly you drink that fluid. Gulping down a lot of fluid wil lead to quicker secretion.</p>
<h1 id="my-typical-day">My Typical Day</h1>
<p>1 hour exercise = 500ml</p>
<p>2 cups of coffee 500ml</p>
<p>10 hours = 2,4l</p>
<p>So I should be drinking about 3,25L in total a day!</p>

      <description>Although I was already doing something very similar, yesterday I discovered MAF training through this video:
This video is super inspiring because he actually runs a 3 hour marathon while recording!
I was already doing base training for my running which I discovered through the r/running Reddit. Here you focus on time instead of distance and do many runs on low intensity throughout the week, and one long run where you go 5 minutes more every week.</description>

<p>This video is super inspiring because he actually runs a 3 hour marathon while recording!</p>
<p>I was already doing <a href="/zet/base-training-running/">base training for my running</a> which I discovered through the r/running Reddit. Here you focus on time instead of distance and do many runs on low intensity throughout the week, and one long run where you go 5 minutes more every week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now in week 6 of my base training schedule and I&rsquo;m progressing nicely. My long run went from 50 minutes to 86 minutes, and my weekly total distance has increased from 20,6km to 32,8km!</p>
<h1 id="maf-training">MAF Training</h1>
<p>MAF stands for Maximum Aerobic Function and was developed by Dr. Phil Maffetone.</p>
<p>It uses <a href="https://philmaffetone.com/180-formula/">the 180 formula</a> to calculate the maximum heart rate you should hit during your run. What wasn&rsquo;t obvious from all the other videos I watched, was that this maximum heart rate actually establishes a zone you should be training in.</p>
<p>I discovered this in Dr. Maffetone&rsquo;s Book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once a maximum aerobic heart rate is found, a training range from this heart rate to 10 beats below could be used as a training range. For example, if an athlete’s maximum aerobic heart rate is determined to be 155, that person’s aerobic training zone would be 145 to 155 bpm. However, the more training at 155, the quicker an optimal aerobic base will be developed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="current-situation">Current Situation</h1>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t been paying much attention to my heart rate up until this point. I just used the guideline of &ldquo;conversational pace&rdquo;, and that runs should feel easy and enjoyable. However, I knew I was going to need metrics one day, so I diligently tracked my workouts using my iWatch SE from day 1.</p>
<p>Here are my current heart rate stats and zones:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/zones.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Going through my recent runs, my average heart rate has been around 100-115bpm. For example:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/heart.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<h1 id="time-to-start-nerding-on-some-numbers">Time To Start Nerding On Some Numbers</h1>
<p>Using the 180 formula, I calculated that I should use 180 - 33 - 5 = 142 as a maximum heart rate for my endurance training, which gives me a training zone of 132-142bpm. This is about 15 beats higher than I was used to! And if you look at the zones that Apple calculated for me, you&rsquo;ll see that this almost perfectly matches my calculated Zone 2.</p>
<p>After I calculated my new target, I tried it out immediately this morning. Here is the result:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/firstmaf.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/firstmaf2.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>


<div class="strava-embed-placeholder" data-embed-type="activity" data-embed-id="9143184934"></div><script src="https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js"></script>


<p>This definitely felt very different! After some experimentation and keeping an eye on my heart rate rising and falling, I managed to find a pattern that kept it around 135bpm. It felt much more like running instead of jogging. And I was surprised that even though I was running quite a bit faster than I was used to, I could still maintain a conversation if I wanted to, so I was still at a conversational pace. I had just estimated my conversational pace a lot lower than I was capable of. This shows you the power of using metrics for training! It definitely pushed me to go a little harder, a little faster, even though I&rsquo;m stil doing &ldquo;easy running&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Towards the end my legs started to hurt quite a bit more than usual, it felt much more like a workout, even though I was not totally exhausted in the end. The previous run I shared had a pace of 7.41/km and this one was on 6.42/km, which is a lot faster.</p>
<p>I have come to a point where all these numbers are starting to make sense to me now and I can start tracking them. Especially the heart rate has been a real eye opener. Now I have a perfect gauge to use while training: something that will let me know whether I should put in some more effort or slow down.</p>
<p>Already I&rsquo;m getting so much joy of seeing the progress I&rsquo;ve made from week 1 to 6, and seeing the numbers increase. I&rsquo;m really falling in love with this sport in so many ways, it&rsquo;s perfect for a nerd like me!</p>

      <description>It was a nice week. I had an extra day off on Asenscion day and I decided to go for a camping trip for the first time after I moved back to the Netherlands.
It was a great experience, and I wrote a couple of Tumblr posts with photos:

      <title>8 Simple Japanese Habits</title>

      <description>Through YouTube I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to quite a bit of Japanese culture and I love many aspects of it. I love this list of habits, and I was surprised to see how many of them I already incorporate.
Clean the Toilet Many successful businessmen clean the toilet every day. It humbles you. Ajahn Chah also talks about this a lot. Check out &amp;ldquo;Toilets on the Path&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m also very focused on cleanliness and especially emphasize keeping my toilet clean.</description>

<p>Through YouTube I&rsquo;ve been exposed to quite a bit of Japanese culture and I love many aspects of it. I love this list of habits, and I was surprised to see how many of them I already incorporate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean the Toilet</li>
</ol>
<p>Many successful businessmen clean the toilet every day. It humbles you. Ajahn Chah also talks about this a lot. Check out &ldquo;Toilets on the Path&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m also very focused on cleanliness and especially emphasize keeping my toilet clean. But I like the idea of cleaning it every day and I&rsquo;m going to give it a try.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Put your shoes away neatly</li>
</ol>
<p>Just look at how clean that looks in the video! Fortunately I also have a habit of putting them neatly on a rack I have.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Improve your posture</li>
</ol>
<p>Investing in my Herman Miller chair has been a huge improvement to my life, and combined with yoga my posture has improved a lot over the past few months. I walk more upright and find myself correcting posture more often than before.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Thanking for meals</li>
</ol>
<p>Being grateful for all people who were involved in making that meal. The farmers, the cooks, everybody.</p>
<p>Being grateful for life.</p>
<p>I can definitely improve on this and appreciate my food more.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Put the chair back after you use it</li>
</ol>
<p>Japanese people are very concerned with other people&rsquo;s feelings. Putting a chair back in a restaurant you will make the restaurant staff happy, for example. I&rsquo;m usually quite considerate about these things and generally want to make the world a better place. I have a habit of thinking, &ldquo;how can I make this person&rsquo;s day a little better?&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Appreciate the things you already have</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look at the things you don&rsquo;t have, but look at what you already have.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Okage Samade</li>
</ol>
<p>A phrase that means something to the effect of &ldquo;I am good because of all the people that suppport me&rdquo;. Used when someone asks &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Going to bed early and waking up early.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is absolutely true. I get up at 6 every day. At 10pm I usually start winding down for bed and lights are off at 23:00. I&rsquo;ve also gone through long periods of getting up at 4 or 3am, and I felt great doing so. I&rsquo;m currenlty using 6am because I sometimes have social engagements that prevent me from going to bed very early.</p>

      <title>AI Does Not Grow Exponentially, Thus, Less Scary</title>

      <description>I watch the whole AI craze from the sideline: I am interested in it but I do not spend a lot of time investigating it. But I do pick up a few things here and there.
In this Rich Roll podcast, Kevin Kelly argues that AI does not grow exponentially. It grows linearly, but not exponentially, because it is constrained by the infrastrucutre that we give it, and are able to give it.</description>

<p>I watch the whole AI craze from the sideline: I am interested in it but I do not spend a lot of time investigating it. But I do pick up a few things here and there.</p>
<p>In this Rich Roll podcast, Kevin Kelly argues that AI does not grow exponentially. It grows linearly, but not exponentially, because it is constrained by the infrastrucutre that we give it, and are able to give it. AI cannot grow by itself. We simply cannot provide enough computing power to enable exponential growth because the technology is not advanced enough yet, which means the growth is stunted.</p>
<p>This makes the doomsday image of an all-powerful single AI that takes over the world and exterminates all humans a lot less likely.</p>

      <title>Invest In Experiences For Happiness</title>

      <description>Happiness, Hedonic Adjustment, Experiences This was a very good video. I can honestly say that I am very happy and content, and I lead a very fulfilling life. I do not usually watch this kind of &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; content because I&amp;rsquo;m already happy. But this video did give me some very important insights which have influenced the way I approach money and happiness.
Memories as Dividends The main takeaway for me is to prioritize creating memories by investing in experiences.</description>

<h1 id="happiness-hedonic-adjustment-experiences">Happiness, Hedonic Adjustment, Experiences</h1>
<p>This was a very good video. I can honestly say that I am very happy and content, and I lead a very fulfilling life. I do not usually watch this kind of &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; content because I&rsquo;m already happy. But this video did give me some very important insights which have influenced the way I approach money and happiness.</p>
<h1 id="memories-as-dividends">Memories as Dividends</h1>
<p>The main takeaway for me is to prioritize creating memories by investing in experiences. The author phrases it very well here:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you buy a shiny new car, every time you use it that shine wears of just a little bit. You hedonically adjust. With a memory, every time you think about it, you experience joy. Your brain cements the pathway to that memory, and you relive it in your brain, experiencing feelings of happines or nostalgia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hedonic adjustment happens when you become used to the things you like, and you need to have bigger and better things in order to get the same satisfaction. The Stoics, among others, counteracted this with forced deprivation: eating plain bread for a few days will make you appreciate your customary food.</p>
<p>Another very clever point which Damien makes is to see money spent on experiences as dividends:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Experiences and memories in this way are like investments in happiness, because we can call on them to release the happiness hormones in our brains that make us feel good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They can be seen as happiness dividends. You get the initial experience and you get to re-live it again and again. And the best thing is that you don&rsquo;t hedonically adjust to these memories.</p>
<p>This definitely made me re-think my approach to fincancial happiness and independence. I am definitely going to prioritize experiences a lot more in the future.</p>
<h1 id="other-takeaways">Other Takeaways</h1>
<ul>
<li>Variety and anticipation of events or smaller purchases provides a large portion of the happiness, rather than the purchase itself</li>
<li>Make many smaller purchases rather than one big purchase</li>
<li>Take short weekend holidays rather than a big expensive 4 week holiday</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="norway">Norway</h1>
<p>A case in point is my upcoming trip to Norway. Ever since I decided on the date for the trip, I noticed my energy has increased because I&rsquo;m excited about the trip. I&rsquo;m getting a lot of joy out of the anticipation: I&rsquo;m reading up on areas to visit, going through all of my outdoor gear, and getting out into nature more because I want to connect to that Norwegian part of me. This is all rooted very deeply within me because I lived there for 9 years, and the anticipation of returning to Norway for a short time gives me so much joy.</p>
<p>By taking time off and purchasing the necesseties for my trip, I&rsquo;m investing in experiences that will create memories which in turn will provide me more happiness in the future as dividends.</p>

      <description>I ran 10k for the first time in my life today.
I ran to the beach and back in Heemskerk on hardened forest roads, listening to the birds and feeling the spring sun on my face. I felt great and had a smile on my face most of the time. Lots of interesting thoughts popping up in the mind as I run and reflect. Hardly noticed that 77 minutes went by because I was having such a good time.</description>

      <description>With the spring finally being fully released on the Netherlands, my wanderlust has awakened again after lying dormant for two years. In my 9 years in Norway I became a seasoned outdoorsman spending much time roaming the mountains and forests and always spending days or weeks out in the wild with my tent.
When I moved back to the Netherlands this has been put on hold for a couple of years while I focused on changing my career on IT.</description>

In my 9 years in Norway I became a seasoned outdoorsman spending much time roaming the mountains and forests and always spending days or weeks out in the wild with my tent.</p>
<p>When I moved back to the Netherlands this has been put on hold for a couple of years while I focused on changing my career on IT. Now that the career is rolling along nicely by the looks of it, I&rsquo;m super excited to start exploring the Netherlands and see what the outdoors life is like in an area where the nature is significantly less wild and abundant.</p>
<p>I needed a solution to post pictures quickly and easily because I want to start logging my trips as well. My hugo setup is great for text and techincal content but I need something where I can easily post straight from my phone and Tumblr seems like the best option. I&rsquo;ll also be posting more on Instagram from here on out.</p>
<p>Here is my first post:</p>

      <title>Why I&#39;m Posting More on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/why-post-on-social-media/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/why-post-on-social-media/</guid>
      <description>My recent post on E/N blogging led to a realization: posting on social media will be something I do for myself, instead of doing it for others.
When Facebook came out when I was 16 I posted quite a lot on social media. 5 years later I found it very embarassing to read back through those posts and I deleted everything, and since then I have been been holding back on social media posting and deleting my accounts several times.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My recent <a href="/zet/everything-nothing-blog/">post on E/N blogging</a> led to a realization: posting on social media will be something I do for myself, instead of doing it for others.</p>
<p>When Facebook came out when I was 16 I posted quite a lot on social media. 5 years later I found it very embarassing to read back through those posts and I deleted everything, and since then I have been been holding back on social media posting and deleting my accounts several times.</p>
<p>In the meantime I also used social media as a marketing tool, creating very specific accounts tailored to a particular niche of content to drive traffic to websites. This approach to social media broke my relationship with it, and it became something you do to gain a certain response from others. I think this is the case for many people. Whether it is getting as much as possible likes, or getting people to click on an affiliate link, your content is always shaped by your anticipation of the audience&rsquo;s reaction.</p>
<p>Starting this blog has been a breakthrough for me. Especially when I gave up on my tech niche and just started writing about everything that interests me, it became a huge enrichment to my life, and I&rsquo;m going to extend this to social media as well.</p>
<p>The thing is, I&rsquo;ve always been very bad at taking pictures and storing them. I have tons of great experiences and memories stored in my mind, but I sometimes wish that I took more pictures of these adventures. Because I was lucky enough to have grown up in an an age without smartphones, there still is an inherent reluctance towards that whole culture. There is an irritation when I see people flipping out their phones when their meals get served in a restaurant, and I feel socially awkward to take my phone out in public to take pictures of things.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m changing this: I&rsquo;m going to take more pictures of the things I experience and post them on social media. Not because I want to impress others, but because I want to record the things I&rsquo;m doing so I can enjoy them again at a later time. I arrived at this desire because I find it very enjoyable to scroll through my own blog and see the progression I&rsquo;ve made over time, and the things I decided to share. And I want to extend this experience to pictures as well. So I&rsquo;m going to post more on Instagram and Tumblr and write short travel logs of the places I visit and the things I experience, so I can revisit them later and find pleasure therein.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically using these services to my own needs and completely disregard any audience. But if anybody finds enjoyment in seeing the things I put online, that would be a great thing.</p>

      <description>Read an interesting post this morning about E/N websites. Apparently a phenomenon from the early days of the web, E/N websites meant everything to the publisher, but maybe nothing to the rest of the world. The term may have been the predecessor of the term &amp;ldquo;weblog&amp;rdquo; which was shortened to blog.
E/N description: The website&amp;rsquo;s author covers a myriad of topics. It&amp;rsquo;s not narrowly focused. The author writes about everything or at least everything that&amp;rsquo;s important to the author.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Read an interesting post this morning about <a href="http://sawv.org/en.html">E/N websites.</a> Apparently a phenomenon from the early days of the web, E/N websites meant everything to the publisher, but maybe nothing to the rest of the world. The term may have been the predecessor of the term &ldquo;weblog&rdquo; which was shortened to blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E/N description: The website&rsquo;s author covers a myriad of topics. It&rsquo;s not narrowly focused. The author writes about everything or at least everything that&rsquo;s important to the author. The site might contain something useful for anyone who visits. The content means everything to the publisher, but it could mean nothing to the rest of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="/zet/articles/write-about-health-personal/">this post from March</a> I declared that I would write more about my personal life and expanding the range of topics that I would publish on my blog / zettelkasten. And it has a great decision so far.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy the sense of freedom it has given me. Rather than constraining myself to one subject area, I feel free to write about anything that currently interests me. Writing about these topics stimulates further research and more intentional content consumption.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing more and more personal content, and this is the type of content one might expect to be seen on a social media platform. I don&rsquo;t use social media much, and decided to carve out my own space on the internet and write there instead. I will always be the owner of this content, and I can write about whatever I want and change the appearance and presentation.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain why, but there is something very satisfying about scrolling through my <a href="/archives/">archives</a> and seeing the things that caught my interest during those particular months, knowing that it is publically available and that others might be piqued by the keywords as well.</p>
<p>Discovering <a href="https://roytang.net/">Roy Tang&rsquo;s website</a> was also very inspirational. I picked up the idea of sharing my week notes and logging the content consumption from his blog. Reading Hacker News regularly has exposed me to several personal blogs which I&rsquo;ve added to my RSS feeds, and I enjoy reading about their interests and getting inspiration from what they decide to publish on their blogs.</p>

      <title>Having Fun While Running And Exploring</title>

      <description>If you would have told me 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, or even 3 months ago, that one day I would be 50 minutes into a run with a big beaming smile on my face, I would have never believed you, but today it happened.
My base building schedule is giving me good results. I did this week&amp;rsquo;s long run this morning and it was 7 minutes longer than last week&amp;rsquo;s long run.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you would have told me 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, or even 3 months ago, that one day I would be 50 minutes into a run with a big beaming smile on my face, I would have never believed you, but today it happened.</p>
<p>My base building schedule is giving me good results. I did this week&rsquo;s long run this morning and it was 7 minutes longer than last week&rsquo;s long run. I ran 8.5 kilometres in 67 minutes.</p>
<p>And the best thing was: I was smiling. I was having fun. Running on an easy pace has been such a game changer for me. Sure, I&rsquo;m probably the slowest runner on earth. It&rsquo;s more like jogging, just a little bit faster than my speed when I do a brisk walk. But I&rsquo;m running. I&rsquo;m building a base, I&rsquo;m doing the first steps, and from here I can grow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also discovering another fun element to the sport: exploration. I moved to my current city less than a year ago and it is unexplored territory. I&rsquo;m now creating a network of nice runs and circuits for myself and I&rsquo;m discovering places I would never have discovered otherwise. Now that I&rsquo;m able to run longer distances, I can start exploring more. Just running on one direction for half and hour and seeing where I end up. Then I look for a nice way back, and this way I&rsquo;ve discoverd a few nice rounds already.</p>
<p>Today the sun was shining, it was 17 degrees, I did the longest run I&rsquo;ve ever done, and when I came back I felt good: energized, happy and satisfied. The endorphins where rushing through my body. Not exactly a &ldquo;runner&rsquo;s high&rdquo;, I think, but definitely a sense of calm and achievement.</p>
<p>Last week my knee started to hurt during my 60 minute run, but this week I had no pain at all. My body is adjusting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming to a point where I&rsquo;m starting to fall in love with running. I just pray I won&rsquo;t run into injuries!</p>

      <title>My Plan For The D2R Ladder Reset</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/d2r-ladder-reset-may-2023/</link>

      <description>Diablo 2: one of those games in life I keep returning to. Started playing it when I was 12, and I know it inside out. Roughly once every 1,5 years I&amp;rsquo;ll have a phase where I want to play some.
I&amp;rsquo;m in such a phase right now. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been gaming since the Victoria 3 release, and frankly, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much time to spend either. Something will be sacrificed. Currently this will be study time.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diablo 2: one of those games in life I keep returning to. Started playing it when I was 12, and I know it inside out. Roughly once every 1,5 years I&rsquo;ll have a phase where I want to play some.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in such a phase right now. I haven&rsquo;t been gaming since the Victoria 3 release, and frankly, I don&rsquo;t have much time to spend either. Something will be sacrificed. Currently this will be study time. I&rsquo;ve been studying for several hours a day for nearly two years, but with my current increased focus on health and weight loss, I feel I need a break and allow myself some leasure.</p>
<p>Diablo 2 Resurrected will reset tomorrow and I&rsquo;ve been doing a little bit of research to get up to speed on the new Terror Zones and possible character builds. I think it&rsquo;s so lovely that Blizzard came out with Diablo 2 Resurrected 1,5 years ago, and that they&rsquo;re still adding new content to a nearly 20 year old game.</p>
<h1 id="terror-zones">Terror Zones</h1>
<p>An interesting addition to the game which will change end game levelling. From what I&rsquo;ve read, they are suited to farm solo from level 92 or so. Up until then Dia/Baal runs are still most efficient.</p>
<h1 id="builds">Builds</h1>
<p>One of the new interesting build possibilities in D2R is the Fire Druid. When D2R was launched I played an Trap assassin and a barbarian, so it will be fun to try something new. I haven&rsquo;t built a druid in many years, so I look forward to that.</p>
<p>I also considered doing a war cry barbarian, javazon or summon necromancer. But the fire druid appeals most to me currently.</p>
<h1 id="ladder">Ladder</h1>
<p>My plan is to just build one character, and I think I&rsquo;ll keep doing that in the future. When I feel like joining a ladder reset I&rsquo;ll just do one character, play it through the game, do some end game farming, and by then I&rsquo;ll probably be finished with Diablo for a while again.</p>
<h1 id="druid-strategy">Druid Strategy</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be playing through the game in public games. Like every reset there will be a flood of cold sorceresses, so my fire damage will be a good addition to any party. From what I&rsquo;ve seen, the fire druid does a ton of damage with hardly any gear, so I probably won&rsquo;t have to much low level farming. I&rsquo;ll just focus on playing through the game asap and do any farming in hell difficulty.</p>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p>Str for gear, rest vita.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>1 point Oak Sage, and take some summons to get to grizzly. Aim for grizzly by nightmare. But don&rsquo;t prioritize. I&rsquo;ll be playing with parties, so probably not much need for summons, and I&rsquo;ll probably have to re-cast them all the time anyway which might actually be annoying. Maybe better to just focus on the fire skills.</p>
<p>Figure out which attack skill I like. Fissure can be fine through all of nightmare.</p>
<p>Alzorath&rsquo;s maxing path:</p>
<p>Fissure
Armageddon
Molten Boulder
Volcano
Firestorm</p>
<p>Cyclone armor: wait until you have a lot of + skills. So don&rsquo;t bother</p>
<h3 id="use-quick-cast">Use quick cast</h3>
<p>The quick cast feature is something new to me. As an old school player I was resistant to this feature. But from what I&rsquo;ve seen, it seems very effective with the fire skills.</p>
<h2 id="gear">Gear</h2>
<p>Tal Eth Stealth breast plate.</p>
<p>Ort Sol Lore. Save a 2soc druid helm for this</p>
<p>Buy 2soc staff tir ral at Akara asap.</p>
<p>Dual spirits</p>
<p>Magefist</p>
<h3 id="later-gear">Later gear</h3>
<p>Rain Armor
Ort Mal Ith</p>
<p>Ravenlore</p>

      <title>Saw Sabaton Live Yesterday!</title>

      <description>Had a great time at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam yesterday. Went to see Sabaton live. This was my second time seeing them live, and it was a great show.
I love Sabaton because all of their material revolves around history and warfare. They are one of my favourite bands. I was super happy they played some of my favourite songs: &amp;ldquo;Carolus Rex&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Stormtroopers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;To Hell And Back&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a lover of metal music ever since childhood, but I had a break from metal music for about 5 years where I hardly listened to any music at all.</description>

<p>I believe the last live show I saw was Cannibal Corpse in 2014 in Oslo. Nearly 10 years without a metal concert?!</p>

      <title>The Ups And Downs Of A Devops Engineer</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/ups-and-downs-of-devops-engineer/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/ups-and-downs-of-devops-engineer/</guid>
      <description>Next winter I&amp;rsquo;ll be entering my third year as a DevOps Engineer. When you first break into this field there is an overwhelming amount of things to learn. Frankly, this will always be the case. But I&amp;rsquo;m reaching a point where I have gained experience with most of the main areas and tooling, and I can start seeing the relations between them and how they compare to one another.
Just like any other job or activity, there are things that you like and that suit you well, and there are things that you don&amp;rsquo;t like.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next winter I&rsquo;ll be entering my third year as a DevOps Engineer. When you first break into this field there is an overwhelming amount of things to learn. Frankly, this will always be the case. But I&rsquo;m reaching a point where I have gained experience with most of the main areas and tooling, and I can start seeing the relations between them and how they compare to one another.</p>
<p>Just like any other job or activity, there are things that you like and that suit you well, and there are things that you don&rsquo;t like. And now the first phases of overwhelm are confidently behind me, I&rsquo;m starting to learn the things I prefer doing over others.</p>
<p>Being a DevOps Engineer does not mean you get to write code all day. I&rsquo;m currently working in an organization where we&rsquo;re not working fully DevOps yet. Rather than deploying many times in small increments, we are still using patching windows. Managing infrastructure in this way means you&rsquo;ll need to communicate with teams to schedule the patching and submit changes to the approval board. It can involve a lot of emailing and talking back and forth. And sometimes things go wrong and everything needs to be rescheduled again. Although it is valuable experience, and I certainly have the communication skills to handle these kinds of situations, I&rsquo;m learning that I lean more towards the dev side of things.</p>
<p>Today was a fun day at work. I&rsquo;ve been working on a PR for a while whenever I wasn&rsquo;t required to work on tickets. The PR involved refactoring a Bicep template for our Azure Key Vault deployments, which were using parameter files with a lot of repeated code. After getting a lot of good feedback on my code changes, and submitting it for review multiple times, it was finally approved and I could get to work.</p>
<p>I used bash, jq and vim to clean up the parameter files for each workload and submitted PRs. My colleague, who helped me with the PR&rsquo;s, was standing by and ready to approve them as soon as I submitted them. Some pipelines ran into some trouble and required a few more PR&rsquo;s to fix, and there was a bit of pressure because we needed to get the pipelines working before any other changes needed to be deployed the next day.</p>
<p>By working together like this we managed to clean up 2850 lines of code in one day and it was a great feeling to get this job done. I had been working on this for a couple of weeks and it&rsquo;s so satisfying to move that ticket status to &ldquo;done&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the coding! And I really enjoy working with Infrastructure as Code! Somehow it really gives me a lot of pleasure knowing that the code I&rsquo;m writing will be transformed to running infrastructure after it is submitted. I love writing programs in my free time as well, but there is just something magical seeing your parameter file being turned into a functional Kubernetes cluster or Key Vault.</p>
<p>Working as a DevOps Engineer, I&rsquo;m generally having so much fun. I really enjoyed myself when I was learning jq and used scripts to change hundreds of lines of code at a time and submitting them as a PR. And some days, the work is less enjoyable, but it is all part of the job. It all serves to deliver value to the end customer, and if I can have fun most of the time while delivering value, I know I&rsquo;m in the right place.</p>
<p>In any case, there hasn&rsquo;t been a second during these past two years where I regretted my choice of becoming a DevOps Engineer. I love my job, I found my passion in my work, and I&rsquo;m so excited for the future. Cloud computing is never standing still, Kubernetes is starting to become more and more popular, and my skills grow with every day that passes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy camper.</p>

      <title>Vacations In The Soviet Union</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/vacations-in-soviet-union/</link>

      <description>Read an interesting article this morning. Apparently the Soviet Union introduced paid time off well before other industrialized countries.
Interestingly, but not unexpectedly, the state determined how and with whom you spent that vacation.
As members of a collective, citizens were expected to spend their free time in a manner the government and its leading theorists considered beneficial to society as whole, regardless of an individual’s preferences.
Ever since the 1930s, it had been customary for Soviet citizens to travel in groups of 25 to 40 people randomly put together by their trade unions.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Read an interesting article this morning. Apparently the Soviet Union introduced paid time off well before other industrialized countries.</p>
<p>Interestingly, but not unexpectedly, the state determined how and with whom you spent that vacation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As members of a collective, citizens were expected to spend their free time in a manner the government and its leading theorists considered beneficial to society as whole, regardless of an individual’s preferences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since the 1930s, it had been customary for Soviet citizens to travel in groups of 25 to 40 people randomly put together by their trade unions. When adults relaxed at resorts or embarked on tours, their children were sent to summer camps managed by state-run youth groups like the Young Pioneers or the Komsomol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reveals the dedication to the collective rather than the family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soviet vacations served as teambuilding exercises that fostered group cohesion. The closer people got with their family, the further they removed themselves from their neighbors, colleagues, and government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems unthinkable to not be in control of your own vacation to me, born in the West in 1990. Communism, the Soviet Union, and totalitarian regimes, somehow always seem to spark my interest. It is one way of organizing a society, and in some ways it seems like an attractive one. I think it has to do with the sense of purpose that living in such a society might give you. The Collective is most important, and that&rsquo;s what you live for. In theory it is a selfless way of living. But history shows that it has always failed up until now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning this year&rsquo;s vacation at this moment, I&rsquo;ll be returning to my beloved Norway for three weeks in September. And I&rsquo;m so glad that I can decide to go there alone, instead of having to go with a group of 40 strangers.</p>

      <title>The Power of Writing</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/power-of-writing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/power-of-writing/</guid>
      <description>Ah, writing. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the skills that I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently been praised for throughout my life. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good at it, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s because I enjoy it. It led me to getting an academic degree in English Literature and Culture, simply because I was following the things I was naturally good at.
However, just like any other skill, you can only become better at it through consistent practice. This morning I read a wonderful little blog post on writing regularly, and I was touched by his words:</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, writing. It&rsquo;s one of the skills that I&rsquo;ve consistently been praised for throughout my life. I&rsquo;m pretty good at it, and I think that&rsquo;s because I enjoy it. It led me to getting an academic degree in English Literature and Culture, simply because I was following the things I was naturally good at.</p>
<p>However, just like any other skill, you can only become better at it through consistent practice. This morning I read a wonderful little blog post <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/on-writing-regularly/">on writing regularly</a>, and I was touched by his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, some people believe that the art of writing is a skill that can be summoned on a whim, like a genie emerging from a lamp with a flourish of creative brilliance. In my experience, however, writing is more akin to the labour of a blacksmith, hamming words into shape through the heat and sweat of regular practise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="daily-practice">Daily Practice</h1>
<p>One way to gain more experience is to start keeping a daily journal. I&rsquo;ve always kept some notebook or other, jotting down thoughts and ideas as they came along sporadically. But it was only in July 2020 that I started <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-8-start-a-journal/">to keep a daily journal</a> and writing regularly. I started out writing by hand. I was in at an interesting place in life: I was spending two years in a Buddhist monastery, and after settling down for a couple of months, the intensive meditation practice was releasing all sorts of things in the mind and body, and I started to write them all down. I&rsquo;m still convinced that starting this habit has been one of the most important and beneficial decisions of my life.</p>
<p>It is so simple, but extremely effective. And you don&rsquo;t have to be doing anything special, or be in a special place. Just keeping a daily journal where you note down the things you did that day in a small pocket book is enough to get the habit going. Soon you will find that you will get the urge to write more. After several years of daily journaling, sometimes all I write is &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a pretty good day&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s it for that day. Sometimes I write several pages worth of thoughts, ideas and these longer writings often have powerful effects.</p>
<h1 id="the-power-of-writing">The Power Of Writing</h1>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll be struggling with something, and I&rsquo;ll be at a loss of what to do. The thoughts just keep whirling about aimlessly and no solution to the particular problem at hand seems to emerge from the chaos. Whenever I am in such a situation, I sit down, close my eyes, observe what is going on, and I start to write. I write it all down. The thoughts, the associations that these thoughts generate, and the effects they are having. I write down exactly how I feel. Attaching words to the feelings that I&rsquo;m experiencing mentally and physically. &ldquo;I feel a contraction in my lower abdomen&rdquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m angry, and it manifests as a hot feeling on my forehead&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s when the magic happens: something that I&rsquo;ve come to identify as &ldquo;The Power Of Writing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Somehow the act of writing everything down will create structure in the chaos, and the solution to my problem wil emerge, often from very unexpected angles. Is it the fact that it is structured on paper? Or the fact that the visual representation of the contents of my mind enables me to apply structure to them? Is it the fact that I am moving my hands, adding bodily movement to my cognitive efforts?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the exact answer, but all I know is that it works for me. Almost every time. And often when I don&rsquo;t expect it at all. I&rsquo;ll just be sitting and writing in my journal, writing down a particular challenge that I&rsquo;m facing that day. And somehow some solution appears out of the blue. Whenever this happens, I always smile and write down: &ldquo;The Power of Writing&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="mindfulness">Mindfulness</h1>
<p>Even though I might not know the exact answer, I&rsquo;m certain that it is very closely related to mindfulness. Becoming more mindful through meditation and present moment awareness is the key to happiness in my opnion. I developed a mindfulness practice out of writing by creating this ritual where I sit down and identify what is going on and writing it down. In essence, I&rsquo;m forcing myself to be mindful, and to attach words to my mental and bodily experience. I&rsquo;m getting out of my own way and letting my mind solve the challenge all by itself.</p>
<p>You know what? It&rsquo;s happening right now! The Power of Writing. I hadn&rsquo;t been able to clearly capture in words what the mechanism behind the Power of Writing was, but as I was writing this article, it became obvious to me that it must be mindfulness underlying it all. So I&rsquo;m just going to leave it as it is. This is a perfect example of what you will find in my private zettelkasten. I wrote all of this in one sitting, with minimal editing. Just stream of conciousness, writing it down. And I finished with a wonderful realization.</p>
<p>I feel grateful, satsified and happy. There is also a pleasant tingling at the top of my neck, and an energy rising up through my feet. I hope that this might help someone else one day, and inspire someone to pick up the habit of writing.</p>

      <description>For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this neat API to check the weather from the command line. It&amp;rsquo;s very simple to use. Simply run:
curl wttr.in
This will show the weather based on your location, but you can also give a particular location and format.
curl wttr.in/Amsterdam

      <title>Starting My Homelab</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/starting-my-homelab/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/starting-my-homelab/</guid>
      <description>This week I started a project which I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off for too long. I finally started my homelab. Over the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting hardware here and there, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had the intention to start up a proper Kubernetes cluster at home. I got inspired by Rob Muhlenstein&amp;rsquo;s Homelab Init playlist on YouTube which I&amp;rsquo;m working on.
There are a few reasons why I haven&amp;rsquo;t started up until now:</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I started a project which I&rsquo;ve been putting off for too long. I finally started my homelab. Over the past year I&rsquo;ve been collecting hardware here and there, and I&rsquo;ve had the intention to start up a proper Kubernetes cluster at home. I got inspired by Rob Muhlenstein&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrK9UeDMcQLpjUGg5z9Z6Un-axVx06-2J">Homelab Init</a> playlist on YouTube which I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why I haven&rsquo;t started up until now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focused on switching jobs and certifications</li>
<li>Not knowing what to run on the cluster</li>
<li>High electricity costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I found a new job with a great employer, I&rsquo;ve changed my focus towards doing more hands-on learning in my free time by learning Go and diving deeper into Cloud Native technology. Energy prices have come down in the meantime as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve reached a stage in my Go learning journey where I&rsquo;m actually able to start making small deployable applications, and I want an environment where I can do that without high costs or without fearing to break something. I want to learn more about databases on Kubernetes, and I want to start writing small microservices and API&rsquo;s that are able to query these databases.</p>
<p>My lab is going to be my playground, where I can deploy whatever I want and learn the technologies that interest me at that particular moment.</p>
<h1 id="hardware-parts">Hardware: Parts</h1>
<p>For some reason the Raspberry Pi has become synonymous with homelabs. I get that it&rsquo;s fun to run a cluster on something that is not much larger than a 1kg pack of sugar. But I never really caught on to that whole scene yet. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a bit late to the party and the Pi&rsquo;s have been scarce and very expensive lately?</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ve been thankfully accepting old computers that friends were going to get rid of, and I&rsquo;ve been keeping some of my own old hardware as well. I have enough motherboards and other parts to assemble around 3 nodes, which will probably have around 8GB RAM each, but possibilities to attach storage.</p>
<p>This is also what has been keeping me back for a while I think. There is quite a bit of work that I need to do to get these machines going, and probably I&rsquo;ll have to purchase a couple of other parts. However, I also have some functional hardware.</p>
<h2 id="gaming-desktop">Gaming Desktop</h2>
<p>I have an old gaming desktop with 16GB RAM, an Intel 6700K Skylake, 1070 video card and a couple of TB of storage.</p>
<p>This has been my Arch Linux desktop for the past year, but now that I switched to my new MacBook, I&rsquo;m not using it as much. I want to keep it as it is right now, but I could run a few Virtual Machines on there, and maybe consider turning it into a ProxMox server.</p>
<h2 id="old-laptops">Old Laptops</h2>
<p>I have two old laptops. One Asus with 4GB of RAM and a Thinkpad T430 with 8GB RAM. The Thinkpad is actually surprisingly powerful. As a weekend project I installed Arch on it and I fitted it with a refurbished keyboard, and it is a very pleasant machine to work with. However, now that I have a very powerful laptop that I use as a desktop and portable device, it has become redundant.</p>
<h1 id="old-laptops-as-raspberri-pis">Old Laptops as Raspberri Pi&rsquo;s</h1>
<p>Having these two old laptops lying around, it occurred to me that these machines were basically Raspberri Pi&rsquo;s with a large form factor and a higher power usage. Why would I need to spend hundreds of euros on these smaller computers if I could just use these laptops as a starting point for my lab?</p>
<p>Using laptops has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>No additional costs</li>
<li>No building needed</li>
<li>Easy to install Linux on them</li>
<li>Built-in screen and keyboard for quick access when SSH does not work out</li>
<li>Built-in batteries to handle short power disruptions (rare but possible)</li>
<li>Can get going very quickly</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="choices-and-goals">Choices and Goals</h1>
<h2 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h2>
<p>The first goal is to get a Kubernetes cluster running. I will do bare metal kubeadm installs, and later I want to learn more about Talos. Fortunately I feel very comfortable installing Kubernetes with kubeadm. I did plenty of practice for my CKA, and I recently installed it on free Oracle VM&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve experimented a bit with K9S earlier, but I want to learn how to maintain on-prem Kubernetes.</p>
<p>My goals is to learn to maintain production-grade clusters properly.</p>
<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>Naturally I&rsquo;ll be using Linux as my base OS. After some consideration I chose to use Ubuntu Server 22. Some notes on that choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>I already have years of Ubuntu Server experience</li>
<li>Good to keep building on what I have</li>
<li>Working with managed Kubernetes on my day job requires me to keep Linux admin skills fresh</li>
<li>Still the <a href="https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/linux-statistics.html">most popular Linux distro</a></li>
<li>Google uses Ubuntu Server</li>
<li>Well documented and plenty of questions on StackOverflow</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="infrastructure-as-code--gitops">Infrastructure as Code &amp; GitOps</h2>
<p>Initially I&rsquo;ll configure the servers by hand, but I want to have the server configuration as code as Ansible playbooks eventually. However, I&rsquo;ll be using ArgoCD for all of my deployments on Kubernetes itself, so the server configuration is only a very small part of the setup. Just get Kubernetes running and do the rest with ArgoCD.</p>
<p>Perhaps I will expand with larger servers that run multiple VM&rsquo;s. Then it will be very relevant to start provisioning these with Ansible.</p>
<h2 id="networking">Networking</h2>
<p>I want to learn more about networking and use static IP addresses for my servers. I need to figure out how my home network works exactly. Surprisingly, I&rsquo;ve never taken the effort to actually know how the devices on my network get their IP addresses and how they communicate, even though I&rsquo;ve learned plenty about it for my day job and do networking in an enterprise environment daily.</p>
<p>For Kubernetes I&rsquo;ll use Flannel to start out with, but I want to learn more about Cilium, Istio and other service mesh implementations.</p>
<p>Another goal is to host my own DNS server for internal name resolution, probably CoreDNS.</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>I want to host my own container registry (Harbor) and use Tekton pipelines to for CI/CD, and I&rsquo;m playing with the thought to host my own GitLab instance as well.</p>
<h1 id="lets-go">Let&rsquo;s Go!</h1>
<p>Another realization was that I don&rsquo;t need to have everything figured out before I begin. The beauty of cluster computing is that you can add to it as you go. I can start with a small cluster of two nodes and build it out as my needs grow. I don&rsquo;t expect to need more than a few GB of RAM in the foreseeable future, so these two laptops will be plenty to get going.</p>

      <title>Structs In Go - Similar To Classes In Python?</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/go-struct-python-class/</link>

      <description>The Tour of Go is very clear:
Go does not have classes.
One benefit of learning multiple programming languages is that each language provides you with a set of “pegs” that you can use to refer to other languages. As I learned about structs in Go, I hung them to the “Python classes” peg and used that as a reference point. Using these reference points can help you to understand the object of study by looking at their differences and similarities.</description>

<p>Even though Go does not have classes, my understanding of Python classes did help me to understand structs much more quickly.</p>
<h1 id="go-structs">Go Structs</h1>
<p>A struct is a collection of fields, and they are accessed using a dot.</p>
<p>Each data field in a struct has its own type, either user defined or built in.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">type</span> <span class="nx">Person</span> <span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When creating a struct, you can use the <code>Name:</code> syntax to set the values. Otherwise, you need to populate the fields in order.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">type</span> <span class="nx">Computer</span> <span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the first line, the ram is 0 because I only set the <code>os</code> field, and unset fields get a <code>0</code> value by default.</p>
<h1 id="struct-methods">Struct Methods</h1>
<p>Classes in Python can contain methods. What about Go structs?</p>
<p>Structs can have methods, but they are not contained in the struct definition, like you would see in Python. Methods are defined on types, and the type does not need to be a struct. Therefore, methods are defined after you create the struct.</p>

<p>In this example, <code>doubleRam()</code> is my method of the <code>Computer</code> type. Methods take a special receiver argument, written between the <code>func</code> keyword and the method name. The <code>doubleRam</code> method has a receiver of type <code>Computer</code>, named <code>c</code>.</p>
<h1 id="struct-literal">Struct Literal</h1>
<p>A struct literal is a struct which has its contents defined in the source code itself. The opposite would be to generate the contents of the struct through computation or reading memory during the execution of the program.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, here are the similarities and differences that stood out to me in this morning&rsquo;s study of Go structs.</p>
<h2 id="similarities">Similarities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Both can have fields to hold values of different types</li>
<li>Both can have methods</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="differences">Differences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go structs are used for data structures, classes in Python are used for OOP</li>
<li>Go struct fields have static types</li>
<li>Methods are defined separately from the struct definition</li>
</ul>

      <description>I spent the evening learning about the Twitter API. It was not as straight forward as I thought. My goal was to do this project using only the standard library, and I hoped to get away with a few simple curls, but since the API requires OAuth 1 to create tweets, I had to revise my strategy.
After struggling with Postman for a few hours to get the correct environment variables set up I managed to make my first tweet through Postman.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent the evening learning about the Twitter API. It was not as straight forward as I thought. My goal was to do this project using only the standard library, and I hoped to get away with a few simple curls, but since the API requires OAuth 1 to create tweets, I had to revise my strategy.</p>
<p>After struggling with Postman for a few hours to get the correct environment variables set up I managed to make my first tweet through Postman. Turns out that Twitter made some big changes in the free tier of their API, and it took me quite a while to figure out that the functions that are used as examples in the API documentation are not accessible to free accounts anymore.</p>
<p>When I realized I would not get away with a simple curl I looked into libraries, but many were deprecated. Eventually I discovered <a href="https://github.com/michimani/gotwi">gotwi</a> and it didn&rsquo;t take long to make my first tweet using Go.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/tweet.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>It feels like cheating, but looking at the complexity of the library, it looks like I would be stuck in the weeds for quite a while if I wanted to figure all of this out by myself.</p>
<p>There is still enough to figure out in this project, such as curling my RSS feed and creating a tweet out of that, and wrapping it in a CLI, so in the end I&rsquo;m glad I found a working library.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the program I used to make my first tweet. It is a modified example from the gotwi GitHub readme.</p>

      <description>When learning a programming language it is important to start building things quickly and to begin applying the theory. I have a tendency to dive into the books and lose myself in the theory, where I should be getting hands on experience.
Over the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve generated a bunch of ideas for projects that I want to write, and I selected my first project today.

<p><a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/twitter-cli">https://github.com/mischavandenburg/twitter-cli</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mischa_vdburg">https://twitter.com/mischa_vdburg</a></p>
<h1 id="twitter-cli">Twitter CLI</h1>
<p>Programs should solve a problem. My problem has to do with Twitter. I recently created a Twitter account, and I want to make a tweet whenever I publish something new on my website. I&rsquo;m currently doing this by hand, and that needs to stop, obviously.</p>
<p>There are bots out there for this, but I want to build it myself. I&rsquo;ve created the following user stories for my project.</p>
<h2 id="user-story-1">User Story 1</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As a user, I need a command that I can run from a bash shell that will post the standard input to my Twitter account</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="user-story-2">User Story 2</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As a user, I need a command that I can run from a bash shell that will take the latest post from the RSS feed generated by my blog and post it to Twitter</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<p>By writing this program I&rsquo;ll need to figure out the following problems in Go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking input from the command line</li>
<li>Authenticating to the Twitter API</li>
<li>Making a POST request to the Twitter API</li>
<li>Curling an RSS feed</li>
<li>Looping over / reading XML / HTML data</li>
<li>Transforming that data to a suitable format to post to Twitter</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="expansion">Expansion</h1>
<p>This will be a good start for my project and will keep me busy for a while. When I solved the previous problems I can use the result and expand further. Some thoughts about further expansion:</p>
<h2 id="rss-feeds">RSS Feeds</h2>
<p>I can use the skills I learn to start crawling Reddit feeds and filter them for keywords. I can automatically generate a curated selection from Reddit which will be easier to consume and will save me time by only serving me content that I might think is interesting to me, based on keywords.</p>
<h2 id="database">Database</h2>
<p>I want to learn more about using databases on Kubernetes and how to interact with databases using Go. For this I&rsquo;d like to store my RSS feed into a database and keep track of information in the database. I could track whether an article has been posted to Twitter and when.</p>
<h2 id="bot">Bot</h2>
<p>Rather than posting my latest blog post to Twitter by manually running a command, I should have a bot scanning my blog and posting to Twitter when it detects a new article. Or I could trigger the bot whenever I make a push to my blog repo.</p>
<p>In any case, I want to have an application running on a server. I&rsquo;m making plans to start up a proper home lab and this will be a perfect use case to start running on my home Kubernetes cluster.</p>

      <title>Podcast Notes: Dopamine and Motivation - Huberman</title>

      <description>Dopamine Listened to an interesting podcast on Dopamine by Andrew Huberman. I always enjoy his content because he is completely driven by science, not by personal opinion. He is truly objective as far as I can tell.
Dopamine is often misunderstood. It is not necessarily associated with good feelings after you pursue an activity. It is more related to motivation to engage in certain behaviours.
Rewards Scientists did an experiment where they observed children of kindergarten age, and later reproduced this in adults.</description>

<p>Listened to <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/leverage-dopamine-to-overcome-procrastination-and-optimize-effort/">an interesting podcast on Dopamine</a> by Andrew Huberman. I always enjoy his content because he is completely driven by science, not by personal opinion. He is truly objective as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Dopamine is often misunderstood. It is not necessarily associated with good feelings after you pursue an activity. It is more related to motivation to engage in certain behaviours.</p>
<h1 id="rewards">Rewards</h1>
<p>Scientists did an experiment where they observed children of kindergarten age, and later reproduced this in adults. The children were monitored during school days, where they had blocks of structured time and free time. During structured time their activities were managed. They had to sing or write, for example. Then they had blocks of free time where they could do whatever activity they liked.</p>
<p>They observed what activity the children liked to do in their free time, and then started to reward these children for their work. For example, if the children liked to draw in their free time, the researches started giving them gold stars and other praise for their work.</p>
<p>Then the researches removed the reward for the activity, and interestingly, the children and adults started showing less interest and enjoyment in the activity because they were lacking the reward.Note that this is the activity that they liked to do in their free time prior to the experiment.</p>
<p>This all has to do with the nature of dopamine, dopamine baselines and peaks.</p>
<p>Huberman explains this with a metaphor of a pool. In the pool you have waves, and the waves have peaks and troughs. At the peaks, your dopamine is high, but they are inevitably followed by troughs: dips in dopamine, which lead to low energy and low motivation.</p>
<p>Then there is the baseline of dopamine: the amount of water in the pool. The baseline is the relative point to which the peaks and throughs are determined.</p>
<p>So it is important that you don&rsquo;t reward yourself for activities that you are doing. Don&rsquo;t reward yourself too much when you achieve a fitness or study goal. You will feel good after the event, but you will end up in a through. Being in the trough means feeling demotivated, leading to procrastination.</p>
<h1 id="getting-out-of-the-trough">Getting Out Of The Trough</h1>
<p>The good news is that the system will reset itself after experiencing highs or lows due to rewards.Getting out of the trough happens automatically, but you can influence the rate at which you climb out of it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are not motivated to study. You&rsquo;ll need to do something which is more painful. Something that&rsquo;s even harder to do. Whatever feels harder to do in the moment than the activity that you <em>should</em> be doing. Do something that makes you feel uncomfortable.</p>
<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>
<ul>
<li>exercise for 1 minute</li>
<li>do something that really sucks
<ul>
<li>cold water</li>
<li>anything that makes you cringe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>leverage something that&rsquo;s painful</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-holy-grail-of-motivation">The Holy Grail Of Motivation</h1>
<p>The holy grail of motivation: not needing any external reward, but enjoying the activity itself that is leading you towards your goal. For example, enjoying running training in pursuit of a marathon goal. Enjoying coding and doing coding exercises in pursuit of becoming a software engineer.</p>
<p>I feel very fortunate that I succeeded at turning my passion into my career. The journey itself is fun. I enjoy coding, and that activity is taking me closer towards the goal of becoming a good software engineer and the ability to contribute to open source.</p>

      <title>Exercise Stimulates Creativity And Motivation</title>

      <description>I noticed multiple times now that during my workouts my mind is generating lots of new ideas for coding projects or blog posts. It is a well known fact that walking stimulates areas in the brain that which will in turn stimulate creativity. But I&amp;rsquo;m noticing that it starts to happen with strength workouts as well.
Although I don&amp;rsquo;t struggle with the motivation to get myself to the gym, I sometimes feel &amp;ldquo;guilty&amp;rdquo; for not spending that time on coding or studying.</description>

<p>Although I don&rsquo;t struggle with the motivation to get myself to the gym, I sometimes feel &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; for not spending that time on coding or studying. I&rsquo;m realizing now that this is a very irrational train of thought.</p>
<p>Exercise actually stimulates my creativity and will help generating new ideas or help me understand concepts better in the unconscious. It is also massively beneficial for health and general well being. When general well-being is enhanced I&rsquo;ll also be able to focus better and absorb information more quickly.</p>
<p>I should re-frame my thinking and actually put exercise as priority number 1. Exercise time is never wasted time. It indirectly contributes to my productivity and coding endeavours as well.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m still at the beginning of my Go learning journey, but I worked through a few tutorials and guides by now. I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered lots of ideas for programs that I want to write, big and small, but I have to start somewhere.
The best thing to do is to write little programs that solve a problem that you have.
One problem I needed to solve was converting sentences to title case in vim.</description>

<p>The best thing to do is to write little programs that solve a problem that you have.</p>
<p>One problem I needed to solve was converting sentences to title case in vim. There are plugins for this, or elaborate macros, but I thought this was a nice opportunity to write my first program from scratch. You can view the program here: <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/go/tree/main/projects/title">my go repo</a>.</p>

<p>Converting a string to title case is fairly easy:</p>

<p>I wrote the program so I can call it with a sentence as an argument:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">mischa@mac-beast:~
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="o">(</span>ins<span class="o">)</span>$ title hello world, this is my sentence in title <span class="k">case</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">Hello World, This Is My Sentence In Title Case
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But the main use case is to use it as a <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pipes-and-filters-in-linux-unix/">UNIX filter</a> inside of vim. A UNIX filter is a program that takes standard input, performs some operation on the input, and prints it to standard output.</p>
<p>Now, when I&rsquo;m working inside of vim, I can convert the current line to title case by typing the following command:</p>
<p><code>!!title</code></p>
<p>The <code>!!</code> command sends the specified amount of lines to the command you specify. Exclamation marks truly are magic wands! I highly recommend reading <a href="https://rwx.gg/tools/editors/vi/how/magic/">this article</a> by rwxrob to learn more about them.</p>

      <title>My Neovim Zettelkasten: How I Take Notes in Markdown Using Vim and Bash</title>

Digital note-taking provides the following advantages:

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I used to make all my notes on paper, but I decided to switch to a digital note-taking system about two years ago.</p>
<p>Digital note-taking provides the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searchability</li>
<li>Collected in one place</li>
<li>Can be converted to different output formats</li>
<li>Easier to share with others</li>
<li>Does not take up physical space</li>
<li>No risk of losing your notes in case of fire or other disaster</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through several iterations of my note-taking systems. I started on Google Docs, moved on to Notion and eventually landed on Obsidian. However, as I became more proficient with UNIX systems and vim, I realized I did not need all of that distracting functionality, and I switched over to using Neovim and a few bash scripts. I occasionally open up Obsidian to look at my graph view or to make use of the Anki plugin, but I enjoy the trimmed-down version that I built myself. I don&rsquo;t need to leave the command line to read my notes or to create a new one.</p>
<p>In this article I&rsquo;ll show you the system I&rsquo;m currently using for note-taking. My note-taking system is part of a larger system which I call my &ldquo;Second Brain&rdquo;, <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/">a term coined by Tiago Forte.</a> This is an overarching system I&rsquo;ve build to manage my time, projects, tasks and bookmarks. Explaining this entire system is beyond the scope of this article, but I plan to write about my Second Brain in the future as well.</p>
<p>My system is based on the Zettelkasten method, but I&rsquo;ve adjusted it to my own needs. After a few years of experimentation I feel that my system has reached a &ldquo;mature&rdquo; state, but it will always remain continuosly under development, also because my needs may change.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-zettelkasten">What is a Zettelkasten?</h1>
<p>Zettelkasten is a system of note taking and personal knowledge management. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> means &ldquo;slip box&rdquo; in German. Traditionally it is a physical box of slips of paper or index cards containing smaller notes. Each of these cards have a unique identifier, and these identifiers are used to create links between the cards.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann">Niklas Luhmann</a>, who was one of the most prolific scholars in history, used it extensively. He wrote 70 books and nearly 400 academic articles, and he credited the Zettelkasten with making his productivity possible. It contained around 90,000 index cards.</p>
<p>I first came across this concept by reading the book <a href="https://amzn.to/49Pcimg">How to take Smart Notes</a> by Sönke Ahrens.</p>
<h1 id="why-take-notes">Why Take Notes?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your professional success and quality of life depend directly on your ability to manage information effectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiago Forte, Building A Second Brain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the modern age we consume very large amounts of information, much more than we can remember. It is therefore very important to manage your intake of information, but also the retention of that information. I find that taking notes on the topics that may be of interest to me at any given time helps me understand the subject much better, because it forces me to clearly formulate my thoughts and convert them to written form.</p>
<p>Over time a large collection is built up which can be used to generate new ideas.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-i-take-notes-on">What Do I Take Notes On?</h1>
<p>Firstly, I keep a daily journal where I write down my thoughts, my feelings and the activities that I undertake. Some days may be several pages worth, and other days will be only &ldquo;Had a nice day today&rdquo;. But I make a point to write something down every day.</p>
<p>Secondly, I write about the topics I study. I&rsquo;m always learning something new. I&rsquo;m a DevOps Cloud Engineer, and new developments are made constantly in the Cloud Native landscape. There is always more to learn.</p>
<p>My notes are not only work related. I also keep notes of the research I do for all of my interests, such as health, longevity, exercise, diet, literature, yoga and meditation. I made a habit out of always writing a note when I read a book, watch a documentary or listen to a podcast. These notes can be a short summary, a few thoughts that come to mind, or a few bullet points that capture the main takeaways.</p>
<p>These activities are usually accompanied by taking notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading books</li>
<li>Watching video courses</li>
<li>Watching educational YouTube videos</li>
<li>Researching hobbies and interests</li>
<li>Coding</li>
<li>Reflection</li>
<li>Interesting conversations</li>
<li>Listening to podcasts</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="an-overview-of-my-system">An Overview of My System</h1>
<p>My system is a modified Zettelkasten system that incorporates daily notes for journaling. The Zettelkasten method emphasizes small atomic notes containing only your own thoughts and links to other notes. However, I choose to also make longer notes. For example, when I did the <a href="https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/fundamentals-of-bicep">Fundamentals of Bicep</a> course, I made one large note that contains all of the information I wished to remember or refer to later. In this particular use case, I think it&rsquo;s much better to keep everything collected in one note, rather than breaking this note up in smaller notes on parameters and variables, for example.</p>
<p>Another area where I diverge from the traditional Zettelkasten is categorization of notes. Traditionally the Zettelkasten is one big repository of notes, but I like to keep them loosely collected. When I create a new note, my system places that note in an inbox directory. Once a week I go through my inbox and revisit all of my notes. Sometimes I will throw some notes away because I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re necessary after all. When I decide to keep it, I put it in a directory that I find suitable. I have a directory structure based on the <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/">PARA method</a>, but I also have a large Zettelkasten directory where I put anything that does not necessary belong to a category. I mostly keep some notes collected in a directory because I expect to use them as a collection at some point, or because I want to run scripts on the files.</p>
<p>Every day a daily note is created that contains a few checkboxes for habit tracking and sometimes I&rsquo;ll include an inspirational quote in my template for a while.</p>
<p>This is what a daily note looks like in my editor:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/dailynote.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<h1 id="local-text-files">Local Text Files</h1>
<p>I think it is important to use locally stored markdown text files. This is mainly why I moved away from Notion. My notes are stored on my local machine rather than with a third party. This gives me complete control over my data.</p>
<p>Because my notes are stored as markdown files, I can use various tools to write or edit my  notes. Moreover, storing my notes as local files allows me to run scripts on my notes and customize my workflow to my heart&rsquo;s content. This can be especially useful for automating tasks, streamlining my work, or making bulk updates.</p>
<p>I have my collection backed up in several places and on GitHub.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://rwx.gg/lang/md/">this article</a> about the benefits and merits of using markdown for note-taking.</p>
<h1 id="vim-my-preferred-text-editor">Vim, My Preferred Text Editor</h1>
<p>I use Vim, or technically, Neovim for all of my text editing. It took a while to get used to, but my productivity related to text editing has increased significantly. I also find it very enjoyable to work on the command line, not having to leave my tmux window to manage my entire Zettelkasten or keep my journal.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/dotfiles">vim configuration</a> is always subject to constant change, but I only use three plugins that are related to my note-taking and Zettelkasten.</p>
<h2 id="1-telescope">1. Telescope</h2>
<p>I cannot live without <a href="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim">this plugin</a> any longer. It is a fuzzy searcher integrated into my editor. I can search for files but also search within the files using ripgrep, and preview the files as I&rsquo;m searching.</p>
<p>Heres what a search for Neovim looks like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/telescope.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>I can navigate through all the search results blazingly fast using only the keyboard, and I can preview the files by scrolling up and down in the window on the right hand side.</p>
<h2 id="2-marksman-lsp">2. Marksman LSP</h2>
<p>Marksman is a markdown language server which helps me format my documents and to create links between notes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/marksman.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>When I start to make a link it will search through my entire Zettelkasten and look for matches based on the filename or markdown headers. Here it shows me suggestions related to markdown.</p>
<h2 id="3-pandoc">3. Pandoc</h2>
<p>According to Wikipedia, &ldquo;Pandoc is a free-software document converter, widely used as a writing tool (especially by scholars) and as a basis for publishing workflows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I use the Pandoc plugin for vim to export my notes to different formats when I need to.</p>
<p>However, the thing I like most about it is that it renders my notes very nicely as I&rsquo;m writing them. I really like how headings look, and that it will <strong>make text bold</strong> while editing, which did not work when I used nvim-markdown.</p>
<h1 id="bash">Bash</h1>
<p>To facilitate my workflow I wrote a few bash scripts.</p>
<p>When I want to take a note, I run the <code>zet</code> command from the command line. This command is a bash script I wrote which creates a file in my inbox, adds a template to it, and opens the file in Neovim. I can either provide a filename to it as an argument or it will ask me to provide one.</p>
<p>I have another script named <code>blog</code> which I use to create notes that I intend on publishing on my website. These files are stored in a different location and use a different template. The blog script also has a <code>pub</code> function that will publish the script directly to my website in a few seconds after I&rsquo;m done writing.</p>
<p>These scripts can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/dotfiles/tree/main/scripts">dotfiles repo</a>.</p>
<h1 id="identifiers-and-filenames">Identifiers and Filenames</h1>
<p>The Zettelkasten method assigns unique identifiers to notes. I generate a unique identifier from the current date and time, but I never really use these identifiers. However, since I&rsquo;ve been doing this consistently from the beginning, I&rsquo;ll keep generating them to make my system future proof. Who knows, maybe they will become useful someday when I suddenly find a use case for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen other people use unique identifiers in filenames as well, but this is a big no for me. I want to be able to discern what the contents might be from the filename whenever I&rsquo;m navigating around my directory structure. Using the filename as the note identifier is a much better solution in my opinion. There is a small chance that you will choose a filename that already exists, but you can easily add a number to it or change a word and you have solved that problem.</p>
<p>Moreover, I use the marksman LSP server to create links between my notes in Neovim. The LSP server is based on headings and filenames, so I&rsquo;m really glad that I chose to use filenames such as &ldquo;fundamentals-of-bicep.md&rdquo; right from the beginning.</p>
<h1 id="tags-and-links">Tags and Links</h1>
<p>If you are as deep into note-taking systems as I am, you might have come across the problem of using tags versus using links for your note-taking system.</p>
<p>I primarily use <code>[[markdown links]]</code> to create links in my notes. This is also why you will sometimes see these things in my public zettelkasten. The links between notes are rendered beatifully by Obsidian in the graph view. This is also why I&rsquo;ll always try to keep my system compatible with Obsidian, even though I&rsquo;ve moved away from the application almost entirely.</p>
<p>Here is a graph view of my Zettelkasten:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/graph-view.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>For the notes in my Zettelkasten which are intended to be published on my website, I use tags in the YAML frontmatter. These are used by my static website generator, Hugo, to create tag pages on my website which I think will be useful to my readers.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the YAML front matter of one of these notes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nn">---</span><span class="w">

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s about it. My system is a minimalistic set of tools utilized for maximum productivity. It&rsquo;s Neovim with a few plugins and a couple of helper scripts I wrote in bash that store markdown files in a directory structure that I find meaningful. After using many different applications and solutions, I&rsquo;m extremely satisfied with the system I built for  myself which is very basic, free from distractions and tailored to my own needs.</p>
<p>When I want to reflect on a certain topic or to write an article, I go through my collection of notes and link them together. Very often I find that the creation of these links will stimulate even more new connections and associations, and I end up with new ideas and more topics of study I want to explore and write about. I use my Zettelkasten as a vehicle for reflection, learning and creativity.</p>
<p>I love the simplicity of my system. It enables me to capture notes very quickly while I&rsquo;m working or studying with very little effort. By storing my note collection on my iCloud drive and in GitHub, they can be accessed from all of my devices across all different operating systems.</p>
<p>I hope that this article may give you some inspiration to start building your own note collection. You don&rsquo;t need to build your own system like I have done, any app that satisfies your needs can be used. Keeping notes on the things I encounter in life is one of the most enriching habits I&rsquo;ve acquired. It will be interesting to see how large my collection grows over the years!</p>

<p>However, if no arguments are passed to the greet program, discovered in case <code>name</code> is empty, we ask the user for input. We capture the input by <code>os.Stdin</code> and pass it to the <code>ReadLine()</code> function, which is located at internal/readline.go.</p>

Next, we determine that ReadLine should return two values of type string and error. I&rsquo;m saving to learn about interfaces for another day, I&rsquo;m just going to work through this function now.</p>
<p>We assign the output of <code>bufio.NewReader(in).ReadString('\n')</code> to two new variables named <code>out</code> and <code>err</code> using the &ldquo;walrus operator&rdquo; <code>:=</code> which detects the types automatically. We can do it like this because ReadString returns (string, error).</p>
<p>We take the <code>in</code> argument of type <code>io.Reader</code> which was passed to the ReadLine function, which in this case is the <code>io.Stdin</code> that came from our main function, and pass it on to <code>bufio.NewReader(in)</code>. Then we are able to read the string until the newline character <code>\n</code> in the string, and trim off the whitespace from the beginning and the end of the string by calling TrimSpace on the <code>out</code> variable.</p>
<p>Then we return the trimmed string back to our original main function, which will pass it on to the <code>Hi()</code> function.</p>
<p>However, if the <code>bufio.NewReader(in).ReadString('\n')</code> should return an error, it is caught by this code in the main function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="line"><span class="cl">		<span class="k">if</span> <span class="nx">err</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="kc">nil</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">		<span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is a standard way of handling errors in Go. If the error is anything else than nil, we will print the error and end the function with the return keyword.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really glad I took the time to talk / write myself through this program. I think I&rsquo;m going to make a habit of this as I&rsquo;m learning Go. It made everything much clearer when I sat down and traced the arguments from function to function and describing every step in my own words.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t go to the books. Stay with the spec, write your own projects, and find one or two or 10 Go projects and study the crap out of them.</p>
<p>Study the code bases. Kind is a good codebase.</p>
<p>Read the Go codebase!</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/9hEnzD-bNy4?t=8467">https://youtu.be/9hEnzD-bNy4?t=8467</a></p>
<p>Read other people&rsquo;s code and see if your code looks like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good artists copy, great artists steal.&rdquo; - quote accredited to Steve Jobs but it has its origin in T.S. Eliot and even further back.</p>
<p><strong>Start with the tests! Read the tests first.</strong></p>
<h1 id="searching-go-documentation">Searching Go Documentation</h1>
<p>Always search for golang when searching on the net. Preferably text based searching.</p>
<p>Then you use <code>go doc os.Stderr</code> - for example.</p>
<h1 id="variable-names">Variable Names</h1>
<p>Long variable names are frowned upon in the Go community. They should be as short as they need to be.</p>
<p>If using in a tight scope, a single letter is fine. In a block two or three characters is more than enough. It distracts from reading the code if they have very long names.</p>
<p>The more remote the variable is, the more descriptive it should be.</p>

<h1 id="top-level-libraries">Top Level Libraries</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s not common to make a single utility at a top-level GitHub repo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that you are going to want to reuse code somewhere.</p>
<p>You should start thinking of things as composition. &ldquo;How is this code going to be used by other people&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Go is different than bash: you will use this code elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the function of what I&rsquo;m creating?</li>
<li>Create these as small composable blocks</li>
<li>So you can use them later</li>

<p>Being able to look up information quickly and taking notes about them is just as important as the coding itself.</p>
<h1 id="packages-or-libraries">Packages or Libraries</h1>
<p>You can either have a command, which will be a main package, or you can have an importable library named <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.go. Should have any other name besides main.</p>
<p>You rarely want your top level of your module to be a package.</p>
<p>Convention: cmd directory.</p>
<p>This is specifically for separate commands.</p>
<h2 id="stuttering">Stuttering</h2>
<p><code>greet.Greet()</code> is called stuttering in go. Don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<h1 id="modules">Modules</h1>
<p>A module can be defined as &ldquo;a GitHub repo with a go.mod&rdquo; in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A collection of Go packages stored in a file tree with a go.mod file at its root&rdquo;</p>
<p>The go.mod contains the import path of the module.</p>
<h2 id="what-module-does-greet-belong-to">What Module Does Greet Belong To?</h2>
<p>In the case of our greet command, it belongs to the greet module located at:</p>
<p><code>github.com/mischavandenburg/go/rwxrob/boost2022/challenges/greet</code></p>
<p>Greet has a main package which is part of the greet module.</p>
<p>Now we will add another command with another main package to this module.</p>
<h1 id="cli">CLI</h1>
<p>Stuff that has to do with interacting with the user on the command line should never be in the package library. The package library should be written to be solid no matter what.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;name&rdquo; for our greet program should be able to come to anywhere.</p>
<h1 id="avoid-interactive-input">Avoid Interactive Input</h1>
<p>You generally want to avoid interactive input. Prefer arguments, env variables or file inputs.</p>
<p>If you call your program from another script it will stall if it waits for interactive input.</p>
<p>A good example is forgetting &ldquo;-y&rdquo; when running apt-get.</p>
<p>An interactive story game is a different use case than a CLI tool.</p>
<p>UNIX filters are specifically designed to read input and generate an output based on the input. Here it is expected behaviour to stall if no input is given.</p>
<h1 id="runes">Runes</h1>
<p>A rune is a single Unicode point.</p>
<p>The same people who created Go, created the Unicode standard.</p>
<p>Go has the best Unicode support.</p>
<h1 id="writing-documentation">Writing Documentation</h1>
<p>Convention is to always start with the name of the thing you are documenting. When documenting a function, always start with the function name. For example <code>// ReadLine reads from standard input</code></p>
<p>Use <code>go doc --all</code> to see a print of all the documentation in your package.</p>
<p>The same goes for packages. Always start with &ldquo;Package internal does bla bla&rdquo;</p>

      <title>How to Run Newsboat in Zenmode</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/newsboat-in-zenmode/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/newsboat-in-zenmode/</guid>
      <description>To read the news free from distractions and ads I use Newsboat as a reader for RSS feeds.
However, one thing that annoyed me was that it would span across my entire screen in the terminal. When you read blogs or news pages in the browser, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that the text is always located in a middle column of the window, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to move your neck while reading.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To read the news free from distractions and ads I use Newsboat as a reader for RSS feeds.</p>
<p>However, one thing that annoyed me was that it would span across my entire screen in the terminal. When you read blogs or news pages in the browser, you&rsquo;ll notice that the text is always located in a middle column of the window, so you don&rsquo;t have to move your neck while reading. At least, this is the case with well designed websites that serve text content.</p>
<p>Vim has a plugin that achieves this and I use it extensively. It is called Zenmode. In Neovim I use a similar plugin called No Neckpain.</p>
<p>To achieve a similar configuration for Newsboat I used tmux. I wrote the following bash script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># nb opens a new pane and runs newsboat in it. I want to read from a centered column in my screen.</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">tmux split-pane -h <span class="se">\;</span> resize-pane -x 130<span class="se">\;</span> send -t <span class="m">2</span> <span class="s2">&#34;newsboat&#34;</span> Enter<span class="se">\;</span> send -t <span class="m">1</span> <span class="s2">&#34;clear&#34;</span> Enter
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that this needs to be run from within an existing tmux window with no split panes.</p>
<p>It splits the current window in to two panes, resizes the new pane to a width of 130 pixels and sends the &ldquo;newsboat&rdquo; command to the new pane, and the &ldquo;clear&rdquo; command to the old (left) pane to keep it nice and clean.</p>
<p>In my <code>~/.newsboat/config</code> file I added the following setting:</p>
<p><code>text-width 72</code></p>
<p>This will limit the text on the right hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>The end result looks like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/newsboat-zen.png" type="" alt="Newsboat Zenmode"  /></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>This is why Google&rsquo;s Borg was called Borg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computers are drones of a larger collective</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every node puts all the resources into the collective.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The collective is all the nodes combined, and Kubernetes is the Borg that orchestrates everything. It sees available resources and allocates the work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>Borg is the internal system developed at Google to run their infrastructure. You can read about it in the <a href="https://sre.google/books/">Site Reliability Engineering</a> books and I highly recommend them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes is /proc for the cloud</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="containers-size-matters">Containers: Size Matters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Size matters (again) in the cloud</li>
<li>The smaller your container the better, because it takes less resources and less costs</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="devops">DevOps</h1>
<p>DevOps is not the same as Cloud Native. It is one piece of it, a specific set of practices and actions that can be done within Cloud Native.</p>
<ul>
<li>How you write software and release it</li>
<li>CI/CD</li>
<li>Focused on getting the software out</li>
<li>GitLab has become the one stop shop</li>
<li>Purpose is to write software and get it published fast</li>
<li>GitOps</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>In summary, &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; stands for the services offered by cloud providers such as AWS, Azure and GCP. Cloud Native stands for all of the technology that makes these cloud services possible. DevOps is part of Cloud Native, but definitely not the same thing. DevOps is concerned with how software is written and released.</p>

      <title>Converting markdown to PDF on MacOS</title>

      <description>It happens that I want to share my notes with friends that just simply want a pdf instead of a markdown file.
This morning I figured out a quick way to convert markdown to pdf on a M2 MacBook running MacOS Ventura.
You need the pandoc and wkhtmltopdf packages.
brew install pandoc wkhtmltopdf To convert:
pandoc 00-zettelkasten/Fundamentals\ of\ Bicep.md --pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf -o /tmp/test.pdf This will output a pdf to my /tmp/ directory and it looks pretty good.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I reached a significant milestone. I ran my first 5K!
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been on the heavy side. I did a lot of weightlifting from age 18 to around 27 and I was always rather bulky, but very strong. This meant I was very good at working in the woods or helping people move house, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to do any running or endurance because my knees would start protesting very quickly.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I reached a significant milestone. I ran my first 5K!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been on the heavy side. I did a lot of weightlifting from age 18 to around 27 and I was always rather bulky, but very strong. This meant I was very good at working in the woods or helping people move house, but I&rsquo;ve never been able to do any running or endurance because my knees would start protesting very quickly. However, I always admired endurance athletes and I had the desire to be able to run more than a few minutes without feeling the urge to die on the spot.</p>
<p>Over the past 1,5 years I lost 20kg (~44 pounds) so I decided to give it yet another try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been this lightweight so I decided to give running another try. I started small with only 10 minutes but over the course of two months I built it up gradually.</p>
<p>Last week I ran 4km and it felt pretty good, so I just decided to push a little bit more and try for my goal of 5k, and it went well! It feels like quite an accomplishment to me.</p>
<p>Now that I lost all this weight running actually feels good, and it is liberating to discover a whole new area of exercise that I haven&rsquo;t explored yet: endurance. Looking back to my progress over a couple of months, I&rsquo;m curious how far I&rsquo;ll come and what my limits are.</p>

I hope that the new &amp;ldquo;Start Here&amp;rdquo; page will do a better job of explaining the how and why of my website, and that the search function will help you nagivate my website better.</description>

      <description>I do all of my writing in markdown. I keep my diaries in my Second Brain, I constantly write notes on the topics I&amp;rsquo;m studying, and my entire blog is written in markdown.
Some of the writing is done in Obsidian but I&amp;rsquo;m moving away from Obsidian step by step. I&amp;rsquo;ll still keep my second brain compatible with it, but I want to be able to do all of my writing in (neo)vim.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using nvim-markdown for a while now and I was quite happy with it, but it was bothering me that <strong>bold text</strong> was not rendered in my editor.</p>
<p>Pandoc had been on my radar for a while because it uses the Commonmark <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/">markdown spec</a> and it can be used to convert to many different documentation types. It&rsquo;s an interesting thought to keep my entire collection of notes and writings compatible with something that can be converted into anything.</p>
<p>I noticed rwxrob uses pandoc as one of his few vim plugins.</p>
<p>It took me an hour to make it compatible with neovim and to disable the spelling and folding. I couldn&rsquo;t just set the provided variables because they are still in vimscript and I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to set them yet because they use a hashtag in their name #</p>
<p>So far I like it, but there are a few things that I miss from my nvim-markdown</p>
<ul>
<li>automatic bulleted list</li>
<li>nested bulleted lists
<ul>
<li>with nvim-markdown these lists would continue</li>
<li>Here I have to indent each line myself and add a bullet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>navigation between headers
<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t use this much to be honest, but I haven&rsquo;t figured it out in pandoc yet. Maybe it is possible?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I find myself using bullete lists and nested lists a lot in my notes, but I wonder if it is better to step away from those and make more use of markdown headings.</p>

      <title>How to Surround a Word with Quotes in Vim</title>

      <description>[[Neovim]]
I find myself quoting words very often in vim when I&amp;rsquo;m writing bash code. I used to do this by simply navigating around the word and typing them, but I knew there had to be a better way.
I found this vim command:
ciw&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt;P
&amp;ldquo;c&amp;rdquo; deletes into register and enters insert mode. &amp;ldquo;iw&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;inner word&amp;rdquo; and selects the word.
So we delete the entire word and enter insert mode.</description>

<p>So we delete the entire word and enter insert mode. Then we type two quotes, and we press &ldquo;P&rdquo; to paste the register (containing the word) before the cursor.</p>
<p>Voila, the word is surrounded by quotes.</p>
<p>To make it even easier, I added this to my keymaps, and I&rsquo;ll add a few more for parentheses and brackets.</p>
<p><code>vim.keymap.set(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;&lt;leader&gt;wsq&quot;, 'ciw&quot;&quot;&lt;Esc&gt;P', { desc = &quot;Word Surround Quotes&quot; })</code></p>

      <title>What is the difference between a Go module and a package?</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/package-module-go/</link>

      <description>A module is generally associated with a single git repo.
You can have a module with multiple packages, and each package would get its own subdirectory.
You should always name your main file main.go
creating a module Use the go mod init {{your path here}} command to initiate a module.
multiple modules I was running into some trouble with this because I want to have one big repo where I will store all my go projects.</description>

<p>I was running into some trouble with this because I want to have one big repo where I will store all my go projects.</p>
<p>My gopls LSP in Neovim would start throwing errors when I added multiple projects in my repo.</p>
<p>The fix is to create a separate directory for each project. For example:</p>
<p>/go/hello/main.go</p>
<p>/go/hi/main.go</p>
<p>Hello and Hi are each separate projects.</p>
<p>Now I enter each of these directories and run <code>go mod init hello</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this isn&rsquo;t good practice for production code, but it serves its purpose to collect all my learning code in one place.</p>

      <title>Had a CLI Shokunin Moment Today</title>

      <description>Today was meal-prepping day and I cut up some vegetables for the coming week. I’m on a strict caloric restriction regimen and need to meticulously track and plan all the food that I consume.
I cut up three kinds of vegetables and wrote down how many grams of each I cut up so I could divide them by three and add them to my calorie tracking application.
As I took out my phone to pick up my calculator to divide each number, my inner engineer started complaining about the fact that I had to do three calculations and that it would be much better to loop over an array of these values.</description>

<p>As I took out my phone to pick up my calculator to divide each number, my inner engineer started complaining about the fact that I had to do three calculations and that it would be much better to loop over an array of these values.</p>
<p>I had my laptop nearby with a terminal open and wrote this instead:</p>

I’m also happy to see my progress in command line work. I chose to go the hard way, using bash instead of zsh and doing all my editing in vim and using Linux as much as possible, and it is paying off because I don’t have to think much about these little operations anymore.</p>
<p>Then again, I would be much better off training my brain to become better at doing math without the aid of paper or calculators 🤓</p>

      <title>How to continuously run a Go file while coding in the terminal</title>

      <description>I do all my coding and note taking in the terminal using tmux and neovim. I picked up a nice trick from Rob Muhlenstein today.
You can use this command in a split window to keep running a Go file. It will update when you save the file.
entr -c bash -c &amp;quot;go run main.go&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; main.go
Entr runs commands when files change. Here we are feeding it only one file, but you can also feed it a directory like so:</description>

<p><code>find src/ | entr -s 'make'</code></p>
<p>Super handy to see the outcome of your code changes in real time.</p>
<p>To run all the files in the directory, use the following:</p>
<p><code>entr -c bash -c &quot;go run . &quot; &lt; &lt;(find .)</code></p>
<p>I picked this up while going through Rob&rsquo;s Beginner Boost of 2022:</p>

      <description>Deploying to subscriptions and management groups To tell Bicep which scope to deploy to, use the targetScope keyword, for example, managementGroup.
You&amp;rsquo;re not specifying which management group exactly, this is done during deployment of the template file.
targetScope can be set to resourceGroup, subscription, managementGroup or tenant.
If it is not set, Bicep assumes resourceGroup.
create a resource group targetScope = &amp;#39;subscription&amp;#39; resource resourceGroup &amp;#39;Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups@2021-01-01&amp;#39; = { name: &amp;#39;example-resource-group&amp;#39; location: &amp;#39;westus&amp;#39; } To deploy you use az deployment group create for resource groups, but you use az deployment sub create for subscriptions, mg for management group and tenant for tenant.</description>

<p>When you have a lot of reusable templates, you can use Template Specs to enable your entire organization to deploy them.</p>
<p>You can convert a Bicep file to a template spec. The template spec is then deployed to Azure as a resource, and anybody with the right access and do deployments with the template spec from the portal or Azure CLI. Azure will handle the version control.</p>
<p>You will lose any comments and whitespace.</p>
<p>Bicep modules are intended to be combined into larger deployments. Template specs are for sets of resources with a certain configuration.</p>
<p>Template specs can be used as a Bicep module. You use the following code to import it:</p>

      <description>The past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out a few options to run Docker containers and a Kubernetes clusters on my new MacBook Pro M2.
Unfortunately you can&amp;rsquo;t just run brew install docker and expect it to work. Additionally, Docker desktop requires that you purchase a license if you use it for work purposes.
Minikube works fine as well, but the networking driver for qemu is not fully supported yet, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried any of the other alternatives because I found something better.</description>

<p>Unfortunately you can&rsquo;t just run <code>brew install docker</code> and expect it to work. Additionally, Docker desktop requires that you purchase a license if you use it for work purposes.</p>
<p>Minikube works fine as well, but the networking driver for qemu is not fully supported yet, and I haven&rsquo;t tried any of the other alternatives because I found something better.</p>
<p>Rancher Desktop provides everything that you need. It sets up a local VM where it will run a Kubernetes cluster using k3s. It will configure the containerd container engine for you which you can interact with using <code>nerdctl</code>.</p>
<p>To install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew install rancher
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">#after installing rancher, start it up and wait for it to boot the VM.</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">alias</span> <span class="nv">docker</span><span class="o">=</span>nerdctl
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">docker run hello-world
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And you&rsquo;re good to go. Rancher will add the rancher-desktop to your kube context.</p>
<p>To test your Kubernetes cluster:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">k get pods
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">k get nodes
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># test running a pod</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">k run nginx --image<span class="o">=</span>nginx
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">k expose pod nginx --port<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">80</span> --type<span class="o">=</span>NodePort
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># inspect your services and look for 80:31066/TCP under PORT(S)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">k get svc
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">curl localhost:31066
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Or visit localhost:31066 in your browser. Replace 31066 with the port you found listed under your services.</p>

      <title>Notes: Intermediate Bicep</title>

      <description>Today I finished the Intermediate Bicep module. Here are my notes.
Child and Extension You can also use Bicep to refer to resources that were created outside the Bicep file itself. For example, you can refer to resources that your colleagues have created manually by using the Azure portal, or from within another Bicep template or module, even if they&amp;rsquo;re in a different resource group or subscription. By using these features of Bicep, you can unlock the ability to create powerful templates that deploy all aspects of your Azure infrastructure.</description>

<h1 id="child-and-extension">Child and Extension</h1>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Some resources are only deployed in context of their parent. For example:</p>
<p>Virtual network subnets 	Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets
App Service configuration 	Microsoft.Web/sites/config
SQL databases 	Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases
Virtual machine extensions 	Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions
Storage blob containers 	Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers
Azure Cosmos DB containers</p>
<p>It does not make sense for a container to exist without a storage account.</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-child-and-extension">Difference between child and extension</h2>
<p>In summary, you define extensions with the <code>scope</code> keyword, and child resources are defined by nesting them or by using the <code>parent</code> keyword.</p>
<p>An extension resource is a resource that modifies another resource. For example, assigning a role to a resource.</p>
<p>A child resource is a resource that exists only within the context of another resource, such as a subnet existing only within a vnet.</p>

<p>Extension resources are always attached to other Azure resources. They extend them with extra functionality. Some examples are role assignments, locks, and policy assignments.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to deploy a lock by itself. It always has to be deployed to another resource, because it prevents deletion or modification of a resource.</p>
<p>Resources are defined almost the same way as normal resources, but you add the <code>scope</code> property to tell Bicep that it is attached to another resource in the template.</p>

      <description>The CTO of my new company recommended the Udemy course &amp;ldquo;Go: The Complete Developer&amp;rsquo;s Guide (Golang)&amp;rdquo;. I started today and here are some notes I made.
Hello World in Go We start by writing a Hello World and studying all the elements.

<h1 id="hello-world-in-go">Hello World in Go</h1>
<p>We start by writing a Hello World and studying all the elements.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">package</span> <span class="nx">main</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="how-do-we-run-code">How do we run code?</h3>
<p><code>go run main.go</code> runs the program
<code>go build main.go</code> compiles it to an executable</p>
<h3 id="what-does-package-main-mean">What does package main mean?</h3>
<p><code>package main</code></p>
<p>A package is a collection of common source code files.</p>
<p>One app is a package. If you have multiple files in a folder, such as helper.go or support.go, they should have <code>package main</code> to indicate that they belong to package main.</p>
<p>*Why do we call it main?</p>
<p>There are two types of packages.</p>
<ul>
<li>executable
<ul>
<li>generates file that can be run</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reusable
<ul>
<li>used as &ldquo;helpers&rdquo;</li>
<li>reusable logic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you call the package <code>main</code>, you are telling the compiler it needs to be compiled as an executable. If it  has a different name, it won&rsquo;t generate an executable. Main is sacred.</p>
<p>Any other name is a reusable or dependency type package (helper code).</p>
<p>Another important point is that whenever you create an executable package, it must always have a func called &lsquo;main&rsquo;.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-import-fmt-mean">What does import fmt mean?</h3>
<p>The import statement is used to give our package access to code written in another package.  You are saying &ldquo;give access to all code in fmt&rdquo;. Fmt is a standard library package included in Go. Short for format. Used to print out information to the terminal.</p>
<p>Other packages included in the standard library of go are debug, math, encoding, crypto, io.</p>
<p>golang.org/pkg for documentation on standard library packages for Go.</p>
<p>A lot of learning go is learning the standard packages and how they work.</p>
<h3 id="organizing-the-maingo-file">Organizing the main.go file</h3>
<p>It is the same for every go file, just like the code example at the top of the page. Package main, import fmt, and func main.</p>
<h1 id="variable-declarations">variable declarations</h1>
<p><code>var card string = &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;</code></p>
<p>var: we are about to create a new variable</p>
<p>card: name</p>
<p>string = telling the go compiler that only strings will be assigned to this variable</p>
<h3 id="alternatively">Alternatively:</h3>
<p><code>card := &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;</code></p>
<p>Here you are relying on the compiler to figure out what type it is.</p>
<p>Compiler will infer the type.</p>
<p>We only use this := assignment for <strong>new variables</strong></p>
<p>If you want to assign a value to a variable after it is declared, you just do <code>card = &quot;Five of Diamonds&quot;</code></p>
<h3 id="go-types">Go types</h3>
<p>Go is  a statically typed language.</p>
<p>Javascript, python are dynamically typed language. We don&rsquo;t care what value is assigned to a variable.</p>
<p>You always a assign a type to a variable in Go.</p>
<p>Basic go types:</p>
<ul>
<li>bool</li>
<li>string</li>
<li>into</li>
<li>float64 : a number with a decimal after it.</li>
</ul>

      <title>I started to learn Go!</title>

      <description>For month&amp;rsquo;s I considered to learn Go, and today I finally started.
I doubted for a long time, because I figured it would be better to dive deeper into Python. However, when I reflected on it, I realized I&amp;rsquo;m able to do the things I want to do in Python. I can create scripts to manipulate data, and I can string different tools and libraries together if I need to. So how deep do I actually need to go as a DevOps Engineer?</description>

<p>I doubted for a long time, because I figured it would be better to dive deeper into Python. However, when I reflected on it, I realized I&rsquo;m able to do the things I want to do in Python. I can create scripts to manipulate data, and I can string different tools and libraries together if I need to. So how deep do I actually need to go as a DevOps Engineer?</p>
<p>The breakthrough came when I discovered this website: <a href="https://goodfirstissue.dev/language/go">Good First Issue</a>. It&rsquo;s a collection of issues in open source projects which are suitable for people who are starting out. Scrolling through the available projects for Python and Go, I noticed I got a lot more energy from the things I saw in the Go list: Grafana, ArgoCD, Kubernetes. I probably have a long way to go before I can make any meaningful contributions, but my goal is to be able to contribute to open source in the future.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&rsquo;m going to focus my career in the direction of Kubernetes and CNCF, where Go is mostly used.</p>
<p>I have a week off before I start my new job so I&rsquo;m going to spend a few hours a day to get a good start, and when I&rsquo;m working full time again, my plan is to spend at least one pomodoro (25 minutes) a day on Go. Small increments will add up to something big over time.</p>
<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/go">a new GitHub repo</a> where I&rsquo;ll be uploading all my practice code and projects.</p>

      <title>Controlling Apple Music with hotkeys from anywhere on MacOS</title>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/apple-music-hotkeys/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a little obsessed with controlling everything with my keyboard. That&amp;rsquo;s why I loved AwesomeWM so much on my Arch Linux setup, I hardly used my mouse anymore.
One thing I loved about my setup was the ability to control my music from the keyboard from anywhere. This is a feature I picked up from the awesome-copycats theme for AwesomeWM. This was one of the first things I missed when I made my switch to MacOS.</description>

<p>I started using Apple Music as my music app but it does not have any global hotkeys, and it makes you use a widget with the mouse.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been daily driving Linux for a year now, and it has been such an incredible journey. Building my own Arch Linux system taught me much about Linux and what it means to maintain a system yourself. I will undoubtedly miss my custom AwesomeWM configuration and the freedom that Arch provides.</p>
<p>Technically I could have chosen a Windows laptop and installed Linux on it. But I went for a Mac for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility. I&rsquo;ll be doing contracts for various customers, so I&rsquo;ll likely run into environments where I&rsquo;ll need to use some software, such as a VPN that is not supported on Linux. MacOS will always be compatible everywhere.</li>
<li>Portability. I&rsquo;ll probably be going to the office multiple times a week, and using a MacBook as a daily driver will allow me to take my full setup with me everywhere. I also plan to spend some time abroad, and using a MacBook as a daily driver will allow me to work remotely for extended periods.</li>
<li>Stability. Even though my Linux systems never really broke on me, there is always a possibility. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that with MacOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;ll be switching to my MacBook as my primary workstation, I will continue using Linux for my hobby projects and home lab. So there will be plenty of opportunity to keep growing in that area in the future.</p>

      <description>Last week I accepted a job offer! I&amp;rsquo;ve been hired as a DevOps Engineer by Fullstaq.
Fullstaq specialises in Kubernetes and Cloud Native, so I&amp;rsquo;m really happy I could join their team. I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing projects for a variety of clients, and I think it will be a great place to learn and gain more experience in the Kubernetes and CNCF space.
Fullstaq has been delightfully welcoming and great to work with so far.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago someone gave me a tip. Oracle actually has a really good free tier offering.
You can host a 4CPU 24GB VM for free!
This is perfect for a lab environment.
I spent my evening creating the VM and setting up a kubernetes cluster from scratch.
Use this video to claim your free vm:

      <title>Setting up automated backups on my Arch Linux system with rsync and bash</title>

      <description>For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been stuyding every hour of free time that I had. Now that I reached my certification goals for now, I finally had some time to do a chore I had been meaning to do for a long time.
My Arch Linux system is fully encrypted, and I make backups. But I was still doing it a bit haphazardly, usually every Friday.
I wanted to automate this for a long time now, but I never got round to it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months I&rsquo;ve been stuyding every hour of free time that I had. Now that I reached my certification goals for now, I finally had some time to do a chore I had been meaning to do for a long time.</p>
<p>My Arch Linux system is fully encrypted, and I make backups. But I was still doing it a bit haphazardly, usually every Friday.</p>
<p>I wanted to automate this for a long time now, but I never got round to it. Today I made the first steps, but it is still in progress.</p>
<p>Naturally, I could use a tool like Timeshift or something similar to schedule my backups. However, I want to do it myself using rsync because I want to fully understand what I am backing up, when, and where. Rsync is also used in our environment at work, so I assume it is more common in enterprise and production environments.</p>
<h2 id="full-system-backup">full system backup</h2>
<p>Before I was making a full system backup every Friday using this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">sudo rsync -aAXH --info<span class="o">=</span>stats1,progress2 --exclude<span class="o">={</span><span class="s2">&#34;/dev/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/proc/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/sys/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/tmp/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/run/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/mnt/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/media/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/lost+found&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/home/*/.cache/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/data-hdd/&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/games/&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/var/lib/docker/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/home/mischa/music/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/swapfile&#34;</span>, <span class="s2">&#34;/data-hdd2/&#34;</span>, <span class="s2">&#34;/data-hdd3/&#34;</span><span class="o">}</span> / /data-hdd/backups/arch-beast/01-01-23
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command creates a full backup of my entire root filesystem, and it should be possible to restore my entire system by just reversing the target and destination in the end.</p>
<p>However, as I was coming up with my new strategy, I thought this was overkill.</p>
<h2 id="slimming-down">slimming down</h2>
<p>All I really need to back up is my home directory and it would be nice to have my /etc directory backed up as well.</p>
<p>So I wrote a simple shell script to do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="cp">#!/bin/bash
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="cp"></span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># stop the script if an error occurs</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">rsync -a --delete --quiet /etc <span class="nv">$BACKUPS_DESTINATION</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Made backups on: </span><span class="k">$(</span>date<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span> &gt;&gt; /var/log/backup.log
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>-a flag from man page:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This  is  equivalent to -rlptgoD.  It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and want to preserve almost everything.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ndash;delete: means files deleted on the source are to be deleted on the backup as well</p>
<h2 id="automation">automation</h2>
<p>I have a few scripts running in cronjobs on my system. I have a goal of putting them all in systemd timers, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten round to it yet. For now, I will just add my backup scripts to my existing cronjobs setup.</p>
<p>To make my backups every day, I added this to my crontab:</p>
<p><code>0 12 * * * /bin/bash /home/mischa/git/lab/bash/backup</code></p>
<p>Every day it will make a backup to the same directory and update the changed files, or delete the files I deleted from my system.</p>
<p>I also wanted to have a weekly backup happening on Monday.</p>
<p>I will make a more elaborate script to make a weekly directory, and rotate it with a new directory every week. But for now, I just chose a quick solution by creating a weekly version of my script and running it every Monday.</p>
<p>The only difference is the path:</p>
<p><code>BACKUPS_DESTINATION=&quot;/data-hdd/backups/arch-beast/weekly&quot;</code></p>
<p>In the crontab:</p>
<p><code>0 10 * * 1 /bin/bash /home/mischa/git/lab/bash/backup-weekly</code></p>
<h2 id="to-do">to do</h2>
<ul>
<li>set up weekly backup in the same script</li>
<li>create error handling and improve logging</li>
<li>set up in systemd timers instead of crontab</li>
</ul>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m typing this 30 minutes after I passed my AZ-400 exam. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in a lovely cafe on Leidseplein in Amsterdam and feel relieved. Another significant certification bites the dust. This one took about 70 hours of study.
I started preparing immediately after passing my AZ-104 exam, which was a good move. The AZ-400 requires you to know many details about Azure services and how to access them. For example, Shared Access Signatures are only used for accessing storage accounts, but they came up quite often as alternative answers to the questions.</description>

For example, Shared Access Signatures are only used for accessing storage accounts, but they came up quite often as alternative answers to the questions.</p>
<p>The exam itself was difficult, but the AZ-104 was harder. The AZ-104 exam was more challenging because the questions were complicated and required you to simultaneously balance many different factors in the mind. The AZ-400 was difficult because the answer alternatives that are provided are incredibly similar to each other, and they make you very insecure about what the right choice might be. As a result, I changed my answers many times.</p>
<p>I will do another study guide for this certification soon and publish my notes and Anki deck too. Now it&rsquo;s time to celebrate and relax a little.</p>

      <description>The PAT (Personal Access Token) often comes up during practice tests for the AZ-400.
One way to remember when to use a PAT is that these are only for authenticating into Azure DevOps, never to external services.
For example, you might get a question on connecting your Azure DevOps project with a GitHub account from Azure DevOps, and PAT will show up as one of the alternative answers. By remembering that PATs are only for authenticating into ADO, you can elminate this alternative, and make your choice easier.</description>

      <title>The Pomodoro technique has won me over</title>

      <description>I did a lot of studying last year, and I achieved a few tough certifications. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been good at studying and never struggled with getting decent grades in university. As a result, I never felt the need to use particular techniques to pass my tests. However, now that I need to do my studies combined with a full-time job, I did some optimization and looked into study techniques.
One technique I&amp;rsquo;ve become very fond of is the Pomodoro Technique.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I did a lot of studying last year, and I achieved a few tough certifications. I&rsquo;ve always been good at studying and never struggled with getting decent grades in university. As a result, I never felt the need to use particular techniques to pass my tests. However, now that I need to do my studies combined with a full-time job, I did some optimization and looked into study techniques.</p>
<p>One technique I&rsquo;ve become very fond of is the Pomodoro Technique. I don&rsquo;t have any problems focusing for long periods, but I still decided to try it. I use the standard 25-minute study with a 5-minute break routine, and after four cycles, I take a 30-minute break.</p>
<p>The Pomodoro technique has been a way to force myself to take breaks, which I wasn&rsquo;t used to. I used to chip away at a specific task for hours. However, I discovered that when I take a break, walk around for five minutes, and apply myself to the task again, my mind is in a fresh state and much more receptive to the information. Perhaps the time I spend studying after a break is actually more productive because the mind had a little rest.</p>
<p>The technique also pushed my limits a bit more. I study more hours a day, considering that I also work full time. There is this moment where I want to quit studying, but I ask myself, &ldquo;do I have another Pomodoro in me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve gotten used to breaking things up into 25-minute chunks of time, I started using the Pomodoro technique for other areas in life as well, such as blog writing or coding projects.</p>
<p>You can use any tool you like to start using the Pomodoro technique and pick any break schedule that suits you. I&rsquo;ll link some resources below. All you need is some sort of timer. You can use a timer on your computer or a physical timer. I use the Forest app on my iPhone because it integrates with the iOs &ldquo;do not disturb&rdquo; and &ldquo;focus&rdquo; modes, so  I don&rsquo;t get any distracting notifications when I&rsquo;m on a Pomodoro.</p>

      <title>Using parameter expansion as search and replace</title>

      <description>Last modified: 2023-01-10
In this evening&amp;rsquo;s studies I came across this bash script in a tutorial by Rob Muhlenstein:
!#/bin/bash echo -e ${PATH//:/\\n} I could not make heads or tails of all these slashes and curly braces, since the output clearly indicated that search and replacement was being performed. I&amp;rsquo;m used to the sed / vim syntax: s/foo/bar
After some research I learned that &amp;lsquo;//&amp;rsquo; is a global search and replace syntax of several text processing programs.</description>

<p>In this evening&rsquo;s studies I came across this bash script in a tutorial by Rob Muhlenstein:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">!#/bin/bash
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> -e <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="p">//:/</span><span class="se">\\</span><span class="nv">n</span><span class="si">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I could not make heads or tails of all these slashes and curly braces, since the output clearly indicated that search and replacement was being performed. I&rsquo;m used to the sed / vim syntax: <code>s/foo/bar</code></p>
<p>After some research I learned that &lsquo;//&rsquo; is a global search and replace syntax of several text processing programs. It is known as parameter expansion in bash.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&#34;1234567890&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="p">//[0-9]/x</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This replaces all the digits in the $foo variable with &lsquo;x&rsquo;, so the output would be xxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>To do this with sed, you would do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="nv">$foo</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span> <span class="p">|</span> sed <span class="s1">&#39;s/[0-9]/x/g&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For more info:</p>
<p><code>man bash</code></p>
<p><code>/parameter expansion</code></p>

      <description>My friend gave me a nice tip for customizing the readme on my personal GitHub page. I discovered there is a whole world of plugins and customizations out there.
I set up this one for my GitHub homepage. It uses a workflow to update the readme in my personal GitHub repo with the most recent posts from this blog, based on the RSS feed. Neat!
It was very easy to set up.</description>

      <title>Back to Bas(h)ics: leaving zsh for now</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used zsh for nearly two years now. I have a custom setup with autocompletion and a good looking prompt.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been diving deeper into bash scripting, following tutorials by rwxrob. He emphasizes all the time that it is much better to stick to bash instead of zsh.
Advantages of using bash:
the default Linux shell available on any Linux system full documentation available anywhere at all times with man bash free software less dependent on external plugins and configurations more portable practice by working on the command line The fact that working on the commandline is already coding convinced me to leave my beloved customized prompt behind (for now) and go back to the basics.</description>

<p>The fact that <a href="/content/zet/bash-cmdline-is-coding.md">working on the commandline is already coding</a> convinced me to leave my beloved customized prompt behind (for now) and go back to the basics.</p>
<p>I want to improve my bash scripting, and working in the bash shell will improve that just by virtue of doing my daily tasks on the command line.</p>
<p>Also I noticed I&rsquo;ve gotten used to zsh&rsquo;s excellent autocompletion and menu navigation. When I log in to servers at work, there is always this little moment of &ldquo;oh, I don&rsquo;t have that here&rdquo;. I want to get better at bash so I&rsquo;m not dependent on these external crutches anymore.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m going to port my zsh configuration to bash. My current zsh configuration loads a bunch of plugins, and it is more of a hassle to get set up on a new system.</p>
<p>I want to be able to pull my dotfiles repo and do very few steps to configure my environment.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to miss that good-looking prompt with all the lovely icons!</p>

      <title>How to build and deploy a Docker container to an Azure VM using Azure Pipelines</title>

      <description>I wanted to build an application from a Dockerfile and deploy it to a VM. I used a default Svelte setup as an example app.
Naturally, Azure prefers that you deploy containers to services such as Azure Container Instances or App Services, so they don&amp;rsquo;t provide modules for the pipelines to deploy to docker servers as far as I could tell.
I searched for a long time but I could not find a solution.</description>

      <description>To reach a VM from Azure Pipelines, you need to set up an environment.
Create your Linux VM in Azure.
In Azure DevOps, click envirnoments, new, and select the Virtual Machine option.
A command is generated for you. SSH into your VM and run the command.
Now the VM should show up under environments in Azure DevOps.
Set up a repo with an azure-pipelines.yml with these contents to test. under environment, set the same name as you did in Azure DevOps for your environment.</description>

      <description>For a project I&amp;rsquo;m setting up my environment with Terraform.
I used this tutorial, but modified the code to make it simpler and easier to understand for beginners. The original uses a random module to generate random names, and generates a new SSH key. Also, this tutorial uses expensive VM tiers and Premium storage, which are not necessary when you are learning.
I also thought the SSH configuration was overcomplicated. My version just takes an SSH keypair stored at ~/.</description>

      <title>Attaching the Ansible Language Server to yaml files in neovim (LSP)</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/ansible-lsp-fix/</link>

      <description>When you have an Ansible language server installed, you might find that your yaml LSP will attach to your current buffer, but the ansible language server won&amp;rsquo;t attach.
You can fix this by setting the correct file type for the current buffer:
:set ft=yaml.ansible
You could also adjust the Ansible LSP so it attaches to all yaml files. However, this does not work out for me, because I edit different yaml files for different purposes every day.</description>

<p>There is logic for the Ansible language server to figure out if you are working on Ansible yaml files based on the directory structure you&rsquo;re working in.</p>
<p>So setting the filetype when I needed works well for me.</p>

Pip will install a binary called &amp;ldquo;openstack&amp;rdquo; in ~/.local/bin
If the openstack command is not available in your session, you might need to add it to your PATH:
export PATH=&amp;quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&amp;quot;
Add this to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc to make sure this happens for each shell session.

      <description>When you install a pip package which is meant to be run from the command line as a command, you might find that it is not available to you after installation.
If this happens, it might be that the path is missing from your PATH variable. Therefore, the shell does not source these binaries when initiated, and does not know that these executables exist.

      <description>Rob Muhlenstein makes an interesting point that using bash on the command line is already coding. When you are running commands in the terminal, you are coding one line at a time.
When you put these commands in a file you have a bash script. Therefore, he argues that bash should be your first language.
I think this is such an interesting point. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Linux and working on the command line for years but it never dawned on me that I, in fact, was coding while working on the command line.</description>

<p>I think this is such an interesting point. I&rsquo;ve been using Linux and working on the command line for years but it never dawned on me that I, in fact, was coding while working on the command line. However, when I was writing bash scripts, I did consider myself to be coding. There is literally no difference. A bash script is just a string of commands that you would enter manually anyway.</p>

      <description>Telemetry is the collection of measurements or other data at remote points, and transmitting that data to a receiver for monitoring.
Sampling is used to reduce telemetry traffic and costs for storage and data in Application Insights.
For small and medium sized applications sampling is generally not necessary.
Advantages of sampling:
Throttling data when the application suddenly sends a high volume of telemetry in a short time This saves costs! Keeping a pricing tier quota Reduce network traffic from telemetry collection Three different kinds of sampling:</description>

      <description>This term can be confusing. Initially I thought it meant monitoring of the pipelines themselves. However, in the context of Azure Release Pipelines, continuous monitoring refers to something else.
Continuous monitoring leverages metrics from other services such as Application Insights. You can set up release gates based on these metrics. For example, you can set up a release gate to roll back the deployment if an alert is being fired for high CPU usage in the application.</description>

      <description>Debugging is done using call stacks in monolithic applications. Nowadays it is more common to deploy an application using a microservices architecture. Microservices make it easier to update certain parts of the application, and allow for more frequent deployments.
Using microservices does have a disadvantage: you cannot use the local call stack for debugging, because calls are sent to different microservices.
Distributed tracing is an implementation of the call stack in the cloud.</description>

SDKs contain all the tools you need to get started. They typically contain a compiler, a debugger and an API. But they can also contain documentation and testing tools.</description>

      <description>When you call a function, the system sets aside space in memory for the function to do its work. Those chunks are called &amp;ldquo;stack frames&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;function frames.&amp;rdquo;
These frames are arranged in a stack. The frame for the most recently called function is always at the top of the stack. When a new function is called, it becomes the active frame, and it is on top of the stack.</description>

<p>The function that is actually doing something at the moment is on top of the stack and is known as the &ldquo;active frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the function finishes its work, the frame is popped off of the stack. The frame in second place becomes the active frame. It had been paused in the meantime, and now it is active again, because it is on top.</p>
<p>Functions that are not on top, are not running.</p>

<p>Even though it is a small scale hobby project, I still plan to approach it as if it was an enterprise production application. I&rsquo;ll set up a full CI/CD pipeline with testing in a secure manner. Credentials stored in an Azure key vault and images pushed to a private registry.</p>
<p>This is going to be fun!</p>

      <title>Going to Publish Smaller, and More Often</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve transitioned my note taking system towards a Zettelkasten system. I still use directories for folders and make copious links, but more often than not I put them in the larger generic 00-zettelkasten directory in my Obsidian vault.
The concept of &amp;ldquo;atomic notes&amp;rdquo; is also very important in Zettelkasten methods. Notes should be small and concise.
Up until this point I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing full articles on my blog. I came across Rob Muhlestein yesterday and I was very inspired by his setup and public zettelkasten.</description>

I came across <a href="https://github.com/rwxrob">Rob Muhlestein</a> yesterday and I was very inspired by his setup and public zettelkasten. I think I&rsquo;ll move to a similar approach. Still planning to write and publish full articles as well, but also including atomic notes and personal status updates.</p>
